[I was] doing it as fast as I could and I literally opened the back of the truck and all the groceries fell out … and, like, I am trying to rush because everybody’s watching me … and all the other parents are getting mad. … So I’m, like, trying to open my door and, like, not one, but two basketballs and a football fell out,” Stefani explained. “So he was looking at the balls.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Embarrassing moment aside, things are going smoothly between the couple, who first stepped out together over Halloween weekend, following their respective divorces.

Shelton and ex-wife <b>Miranda Lambert</b> announced they were divorcing this past July after four years of marriage. One month later, Stefani and <b>Gavin Rossdale</b>, who were married for 13 years, announced their own split.</p><p>“Gwen’s moved on with somebody better, who is really good to her,” a source previously told <i>Us</i> of her new man, while another added: “He’s a very nurturing, supportive guy, so she found a good one.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagr5WjerTAxJ%2BYp6FdmsWxuMCipaxllqq7r8WMqZ%2BorJ9ivKd5waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWanl6G2r7OMoZyrZadmg3V%2BlWtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
