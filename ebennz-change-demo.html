The lyrics paint a picture of Ebin as a troubled youth who was once a "cooly," a term used in the 90s to describe someone who was cool or fashionable. However, Ebin now associates with extreme groups, such as the PLO and the KKK, showing that he has become more radical and dangerous. The mention of JMC and JFA, two punk rock bands that were popular in the 80s, suggests that Ebin has drifted away from a subculture he was once a part of.</p><br><p>The lyrics then go on to describe Ebin's drug addiction and how he has become a pawn of the CIA, involving himself in covert operations in Vietnam. The mention of Nicaragua suggests that he is now involved in the Contra War, hinting at the political issues of the time. The song ends on a melancholic note, with the singer contemplating how things have changed in his life since he last knew Ebin.</p><br><p>Overall, the song is a commentary on how people can change over time and how political and social issues can impact their lives. The use of humor and irony in the lyrics adds another layer of complexity to the song, making it a thought-provoking piece of music.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line
