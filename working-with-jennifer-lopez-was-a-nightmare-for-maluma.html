However, she’s also become a well-known diva. The singer and actress has been involved in her fair share of controversies over the years. In fact, not many people who have worked with J-Lo have nice things to say about the pop star. Most recently, Colombian singer Maluma revealed what it was like to work with Jennifer Lopez in the movie Marry Me.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jennifer Lopez's Assistant Quit And Worked For Mariah Carey Instead, Because Of Her Hatred Towards J-Lo's Ex-Casper Smart</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-has-been-involved-in-many-controversies-throughout-her-career>Jennifer Lopez Has Been Involved in Many Controversies Throughout Her Career</h2><p>Like many other successful singers and actors, J.Lo has been involved in numerous controversies over the years.

And then I started singing and I forgot the lyrics. And I saw the teleprompter, and the teleprompter went off.” Then he explained how J-Lo was there to support him, “She held me, man. She got my back.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jennifer Lopez Reveals Meaning Behind Song 'On My Way' From Her Film 'Marry Me'</a></span></p><p>In addition to filming together, Maluma and J-Lo worked on a soundtrack album for the film.
