Youtuber Got Arrested</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-07</div><p><strong>Jeremy Elbertson was charged with six counts of murder after allowing his viewers to choose whether or not to apply the brakes while driving. Jeremy Elbertson, also known online as Jerma985, was arrested by the Boston Police Department after murdering six people during a bizarre, avant-garde webcast in which he allowed chat users to determine whether or not his car could stop.</strong></p><p>Jerma985 is undoubtedly one of Twitch’s most successful users. Jerma had several YouTube followers before switching to live streaming, which significantly increased them. He pioneered absurdist comedy, which he continues to advance in his broadcasts. Here’s everything you need to know about Jerma.</p><h2><span id=What_Became_of_Jeremy_Elbertson>What Became of Jeremy Elbertson?</span></h2><p>One of their targets, according to the Boston Police Department, was the infamous Twitch inventor. Jerma began the broadcast by greeting everyone and announcing that instead of playing Breath of the Wild, he would test his luck by flying down the highway at 90 miles per hour.</p><p>After a brief pause, he stated that spectators could vote. He also revealed that any contributions would increase his speed, and any Prime memberships would cause him to swerve into oncoming traffic for a short period of time. If he survives, he’ll probably just end the show with some Gang Beasts or something.</p><h2><span id=Is_Jeremy_Elbertson_incarcerated_What_Did_the_Youtuber_Actually_Do>Is Jeremy Elbertson incarcerated? What Did the Youtuber Actually Do?</span></h2><p>The Boston Police Department apprehended Jeremy Elbertson after he killed six people. According to BPD spokesman David Pryce, officers pulled Mr. Elbertson’s car off the road and arrested him at Fifth and Turner last night. He went on to say that thanks to Jerma’s Livestream, they could track his whereabouts in real-time and that enough cops had subscribed and voted for Jerma to stop driving and surrender to the police.</p><p>Legal experts expressed concern about Jerma’s chances of being released at the time of publication after fellow streamer STAR was chosen by Twitch chat to act as Jerma’s legal advisor.</p><h2><span id=Twitch_Moderator8217s_Reaction_to_Jeremy_Elbertson8217s_Stream>Twitch Moderator’s Reaction to Jeremy Elbertson’s Stream</span></h2><p>Twitch moderator Kevin Foxx commented that it was great to see a streamer take such an interest in connecting with his chat in this way. It was a welcome change of pace because, according to him, most people couldn’t even respond to questions in chat, let alone let the dialogue play God.</p><p>Jerma’s production value was outstanding, as usual. He purchased a large SUV specifically for this broadcast to ensure that any pedestrians who were hit would not survive if the community did not want them to. As a streamer, he is also very focused and concentrated. When someone died, he would look ahead indifferently at the road, waiting for the next conversation instruction without pausing to consider the implications.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_Jeremy_Elbertson_Get_Famous>How Did Jeremy Elbertson Get Famous?</span></h2><p>Jerma985 is best known these days for his Twitch shows, but he first rose to prominence as a Team Fortress 2 content creator. Jerma’s original YouTube channel still has a number of videos of him playing Valve’s class-based shooter solo or with other content creators.</p><p>His most recent YouTube video on his main channel was posted in August of 2017. He still posts frequently on his other channel, 2ndJerma. Jerma, who was already well-known before joining Twitch, rose to prominence. He has become one of Twitch’s most popular channels since beginning to broadcast regularly in November 2018. Jerma had over 14,000 viewers and over 3 million hours of viewing time in 2022.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
