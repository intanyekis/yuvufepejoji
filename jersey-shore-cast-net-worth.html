The<a href=#> popular, albeit controversial, reality-show</a> featured the lives of eight housemates that spent their summer together in a vacation home. While the show was criticized for its portrayal of Italian-Americans, New Jersey, and the fact that the cast members were not from the area the show was filmed; it is considered to be one of the most successful reality shows to date.</p><p><i>Jersey Shore</i> is also responsible for launching the careers of the show’s cast members, including, Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi, Vinny Guadagnino, and Paul "DJ Pauly D" DelVecchio. The show ran for six successful seasons before ending in December 2012.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Things That Are Real About The Jersey Shore (And 10 Not So Much)</a></span></p><p>Because of the show’s success, a reboot was announced in 2017 and aired in 2018, with the original cast, minus one, returning. This, plus reruns that play on MTV, the cast members of this influential show enjoy a pretty nice paycheck, but just how much are each the former housemates worth?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are the net worths of the cast members of <i>Jersey Shore</i>.</p><h2 id=mike-the-situation-sorrentino---net-worth-300-000>Mike ‘The Situation’ Sorrentino - Net Worth: $300,000</h2><p>Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino was the show's most popular housemate and probably earned the most during his time down the shore. Sorrentino earned about $150,000 per episode and continued making various appearances on other popular reality shows.</p><p>In addition to his time on television, Sorrentino also made a workout DVD, a vitamin, and a clothing line. Unfortunately, due to some legal troubles, Sorrentino's net worth is not as high as his fellow cast mates. After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being charged with tax offenses</a> in 2014, he was sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to tax evasion, which puts his net worth at $300,000.</p><h2 id=deena-nicole-cortese---net-worth-1-million>Deena Nicole Cortese - Net Worth: $1 Million</h2><p>Deena Nicole Cortese joined the cast in season 3 after Angelina Pivarnick left the show. Cortese actually auditioned for the show when it first began but was rejected.</p><p>Since Cortese joined the shore family later on the original housemates, she didn't make quite as much, but her estimated net worth is $1 million, due to her appearance on other reality shows and Instagram ads. Overall, not too bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sammi-sweetheart-giancola---net-worth-2-million>Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola - Net Worth: $2 Million</h2><p>Sammi "Sweetheart" Giancola is the only original cast member and housemate that opted not to return for the reboot, Jersey Shore Family Vacation. Giancola stated her reasons for not returning is to avoid&nbsp;"potentially toxic situations" and to focus on her "businesses and relationship", though she didn't go into details as to whom she was referring to.</p><p>Nonetheless, the businesswoman's net worth is estimated to be $2 million, most of which she earned from her time on the show. After the show ended, Giancola, opened an online fashion boutique, Sweetheart Styles. Giancola also designed clutches and fragrances that she sells through her online store. Top it all of, Giancola runs a podcast with RHONJ star, Siggy Flicker and TV Host, Claire Galtero.</p><h2 id=angelina-pivarnick---net-worth-2-million>Angelina Pivarnick - Net Worth $2 Million</h2><p>Angelina Pivarnick is one of the original housemates but left the show after season 2.

During the last season of the show, Ortiz-Margo didn't pocket as much as his fellow castmates, however, he is worth $3 million to date.</p><p>His net worth is partly made of his appearance on Famously Single&nbsp;and his interest in TNA Wrestling,&nbsp;while also promoting&nbsp;Xenadrine and&nbsp;Gen X Biotech. Otiz-Magro is not solely dependent on his time on&nbsp;Jersey Shore.</p><h2 id=vinny-guadagnino---net-worth-3-million>Vinny Guadagnino - Net Worth: $3 Million</h2><p>The American television personality and actor got his break from the reality show.
