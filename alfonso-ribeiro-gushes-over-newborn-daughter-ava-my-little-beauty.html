What? What happened? What happened?’ He goes like, ‘I love her so much. I can’t stop crying.’ And then he was like, ‘Daddy, I want to marry her.’ … They love her to death.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Alfonso-Ribeiro-gushes-over-daughter-Ava.jpg><p>Ribeiro and his wife,<strong> Angela Ribeiro</strong> (née Unkrich),<a href=#> welcomed Ava</a> on May 13.

This is going to be great. I’m going to have a bed to myself and no baby, no crying, no screaming, no diaper changes,’” he told Us. “And didn’t get one hour of sleep. Just my brain was going all night, couldn’t sleep. I think it was me missing her a little bit.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ribeiro is also the father of 16-year-old daughter Sienna.
