Johnson came out loud enough with details about her relationship.</p><p class=dh>While she remained dodgy about the topic, the 58-year-old <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://madamenoire.com/1120772/aj-johnson-african-men/>admitted she</a> was seeing someone she met during her trip to Africa to expand her business empire.</p><p class=dh>Johnson described the mystery man as a Ghananian who was tall, dark chocolate, and younger. Despite their age gap, he took their relationship seriously from the onset and always made her happy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/85afe2e593e2da06dd5ecd4638937523.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A.J. Johnson in a scene of House Party (1990) | Photo: Youtube / Arslan</p><p class=dh>After commenting on her tendency to attract younger men due to her energy, the fitness trainer proceeded to let the world know she would choose her African prince a hundred times over any American. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCF1_1Ceo0Q">shared</a>:</p><p class=dh>"This is what I'll say. I've learned that American men kick it. African men court. African men commit. That difference alone for me took me from kicking it with somebody to feeling chosen."</p><p class=dh>Going further, Johnson noted that they were taking their time to grow together, beat their cultural differences, and embrace marriage in the future. Her partner's desire to fight for the relationship no matter how many times she opted out gave her the special feeling of being "chosen," with a possibility of marriage in the near future.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>JOHNSON'S ROMANTIC LIFE</strong></p><p class=dh>While the fate of Johnson's romance with her mystery Ghananian is unknown, as the star fails to disclose details about her private life, it seems the two were yet to make it to the altar even though a year has elapsed since the hearty disclosure.</p><p class=dh>African partners aside, some of Johnson's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://liverampup.com/entertainment/baby-actress-aj-johnson-married-dating-husband-boyfriend-net-worth.html>past relationships</a> have made headlines.

Rumors of their romance spread like wildfire.</p><p class=dh>However, it turned out the outing was simply a casual lunch date, with no romantic highlights. Prior to that, Johnson dated Michael Jai White, but the two called it quits before legalizing the union.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>JOHNSON ON RELATIONSHIP GOALS</strong></p><p class=dh>A.J Johnson once shared her take on relationship goals, which has been overemphasized in pop culture and the dating world at large.

However, the sad reality was that the perceived happiness some couples let out only existed on paper.</p><p class=dh>Johnson described those "relationship goals" as a false reality, advising everyone to learn to define what they wanted from a relationship themselves, without giving much thought to other people's romance. She concluded by saying what each person wanted from a relationship qualified as their personal relationship goals.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHAT HAS SHE BEEN UP TO?</strong></p><p class=dh>Since coming into fame with <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOJS1BK3ck">her role</a> on the "House Party," the star has explored a handful of careers while remaining a celebrated showbiz legend.
