“We did two records together,” she said during the December 2022 interview. “He was like, ‘Okay, I’m not gonna charge you, you know you my homie’…When it came time to put it on the album, he was like, ‘Let’s take a shower together."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And not just with women.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I think it’s very common. I think [it happens] to a lot of women. Men too, let’s be for real,” he said before making light of the situation. “I’m just sayin’, you want the beats, I want the meats!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Yung Joc, 42, stated that some people in the industry don’t see it as a harmful or invasive request but as an act of mutual celebration and creating music together. The “It’s Goin Down” rapper then called on women to come forth with more stories similar to Ashanti’s revelation, stating that women are always “propositioned for sex.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I can hear it! I can clearly hear that. I can see it happening. You know, ‘Don’t look it at as, like, you gave me that for that. Look at it like we gave each other something, and in return, we celebrated with a good ol’ hot night of steamy, passionate sex.’ I can hear that s**t!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m a man, and I ain’t ever really propositioned a woman for sex, but you’ve gotta ask the women. ‘Cause the women, who are always propositioned for sex, they can tell you probably a better scenario of how it happens…Ladies, give us a scenario of how you’ve been propositioned for your goods. Leave a comment below. I wanna know.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Atlanta entertainer</a> clarified that he was against sex as a form of payment in business.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I would never, man! Lemme say this…I would never proposition a woman for her body parts. I wouldn’t do that, I just wouldn’t do that. Lemme just put that out there.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX67Cr7OMo6acZZaauqK4xGaknqZdl7KiwNJmraWZlKnDbn2RbGtwamRqhnV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
