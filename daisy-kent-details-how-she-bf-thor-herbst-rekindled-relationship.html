She added, “We didn’t date for very long, but we were always really good friends after, and our whole college friend group is super close.”</p><p>As for who suggested calling it quits the first time around, Kent shared that it was Herbst’s decision — but she called the split “the best thing for both of us.”</p><p>“We just weren’t at a place to have a relationship, and I think at the time we were both just very college,” she said. “And just wanted to have fun.”</p><p>While Herbst is still adjusting to life in the public eye, Kent gushed that he’s been supportive of her bringing their relationship <a href=#>into the spotlight</a>.</p><p>“I called him before I was coming here, I was just like, ‘I might get asked about it. Do you want me to not say anything?’ He’s like, ‘Whatever you want to share. But if you ever feel uncomfortable, just say that’s between me and him,’” she said. “So he’s very supportive of what I want to do and all of this too, but he never ever thought this would happen.”</p><p>Us Weekly <a href=#>broke the news</a> in April that Kent and Herbst are dating. “They met in college at San Diego State University and reconnected after she left the show,” a source exclusively told Us. “He reached out to her first, and it’s been going really well.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The insider noted that the couple had “been traveling all over recently,” including a vacation with her family in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and a cabin trip in Utah. Kent and Herbst also made a stop in Indio, California, for Stagecoach in April.</p><p>An eyewitness told Us that “she was smiling at him and they were laughing together” while the pair waited in line for Vanderpump Rules star <strong>James Kennedy</strong>’s set at <strong>Diplo</strong>’s Honky Tonk.</p><p><a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> met Kent during The Bachelor season 28 when she vied for the affections of lead<strong> Joey Graziadei.</strong> While Kent made it to Joey’s final two, he ultimately <a href=#>popped the question</a> to <strong>Kelsey Anderson</strong> during the March finale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZmoxm63xKerZpyVqa6quNJmn6ivXai1pnnBn2StoJ%2Bneqmx0ZuqrWWimriqusOlnJ1lopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
