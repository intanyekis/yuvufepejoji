On Tuesday (Feb. 20), it was discovered that West had switched his profile picture on the streaming platform to that of a goat, an animal that’s become symbolic of greatness and the “g.o.a.t.” acronym.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The switcheroo came amid the massive success surrounding West and Ty Dolla $ign’s <a href=#>new collaborative album</a> Vultures 1, which is currently the hottest album in the country. Released Feb. 10 through West’s YZY brand, Vultures 1 debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 148,000 album-equivalent units sold in its first week of release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1186140733-4.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The album marks Ye’s eleventh No. 1 album and is Ty Dolla Sign’s first release to top the Billboard 200.

Any further conclusions are discretionary, but are sure to be explored as news of West’s latest stunt spreads.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The release of Vultures 1 is apparently just the tip of the iceberg in regards to Kanye’s forthcoming musical plans in 2024.
