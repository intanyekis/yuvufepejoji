Sometimes, fate's intervention can ruin our well-laid-out plans, leaving us heartbroken and in complete despair. Navigating the future in such unlikely circumstances is easier said than done.</p><p class=dh>Nothing can be more soul-piercing than losing a dear one, and that too, unexpectedly and without a chance to say goodbye. Every life is precious, and with each beautiful soul, several other lives are attached.
