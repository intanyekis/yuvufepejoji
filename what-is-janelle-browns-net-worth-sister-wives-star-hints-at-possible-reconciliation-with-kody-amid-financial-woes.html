She starred in the show alongside Kody Brown and his other wives, Christine, Meri, Robyn and their kids.</p><p>The Brown family had four homes in Las Vegas that failed to sell, and Kody Brown appeared to be at his financial breaking point. The family was seriously hurting for cash before TLC offered the Brown family a show.</p><p>&nbsp;Before TLC offered the Brown family a show, several bankruptcies happened, and the family was seriously hurting for cash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/bce80747-d30f-49fe-beb6-9394263c3d43.png><h2 class=split>How much money does Janelle Brown make on 'Sister Wives'?</h2><p>Janelle Brown has been a TLC show regular since her debut in 2010 and it is safe to assume that she earns stable paychecks from the show. However, it's not clear how much money she is taking home from each episode.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reports</a>, reality producer Terence Michael has estimated that reality families earn about 10 per cent of a show's per-episode budget. It is believed that TLC spends between $250,000 and $400,000 per episode on its shows.</p><p>However, it is expected that the Browns take in $25,000 to $40,000 for the TLC show. However, the money would have to be split between all of the family members.</p><p>Additionally, it was previously reported in 2019 that the Brown family took a pay cut to keep the show on the air amid low ratings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/446c1710-d445-448d-86bb-085396d742e9.jpg><h2 class=split>Janelle Brown's other source of income</h2><p>Janelle also makes money through her health and lifestyle business, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Strive with Janelle</a>. According to the company's website, Janelle has been a certified health coach since 2019.</p><p>Janelle promotes health coaching appointments and also sells a variety of merchandise including water bottles, watches, bags, shirts and pedometers. Additionally, Janelle has teamed up with her former sister wife, Christine Brown, to promote multiple products including Plexus.</p><p>Janelle is also active on Cameo, where she records personalized videos for fans for $35. Janelle previously worked as a real estate agent when the family was living in Nevada.</p><h2 class=split>Janelle Brown's financial struggles</h2><p>Although Janelle Brown has multiple sources of income, she has been struggling financially. In a previous episode of 'Sister Wives', Janelle admitted, "I'm stuck. Financially, I have nothing."</p><p>The reality star added, "Christine had the house, I had nothing. My name is on the [Coyote Pass] property with everybody else, probably nobody will cooperate now and play ball." She further said, "I can't believe I'm 50 and I can't even do my own thing 'cause I'm so tied up with them financially. And I can't do anything."</p><p>For the unaware, Kody and his wives, Christine, Meri, Robyn, and Janelle, purchased four parcels of land called Coyote Pass in Flagstaff, Arizona for $820,000 in 2018 when the family moved from Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>At the time, Kody planned to split the property into five parcels, so that he and his now three exes could build homes. However, the constructions are yet to be done at the property and it was reported that Kody has no plan to do so.</p><p>Meanwhile, Janelle spoke about her plans to Christine in her current apartment and how her dream home would be where she would have her kids stay as they please. She had a detailed property plan of the 1,200-square-foot house that was printed on a large piece of paper.</p><p>In a premiere episode of the TLC show's latest season, Janelle said, "I thought we would be so much further along in the building process, but that's just taken a long time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/ae0a8719-453a-4f5b-b7c2-58a330233af5.jpg><h2 class=split>Janelle and Kody Brown's explosive feud on 'Sister Wives' Season 18</h2><p>In 'Sister Wives' Season 18, Janelle sat down with Kody Brown and got into it about his relationship with their six kids, most notably with sons Garrison and Gabe. As you may recall, Kody tried to kick out his sons of the house during the COVID-19 pandemic early last year for going against some of the strict rules he had put in place.</p><p>In a confessional, Janelle explained the extreme issue and noted how "Kody feels like it's my responsibility to facilitate this relationship between him and my children" despite the fact that "he is a parent as much as I am."</p><p>However, the conversation went wrong and things quickly got heated, with Janelle telling her husband that he's 'always flipping it back on me.' The explosive feud puts Janelle and Kody's relationship to an end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/460c47af-ee40-4851-a216-772d4df9ee36.png><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Do Janelle and Kody Brown still have 'physical compatibility'?
