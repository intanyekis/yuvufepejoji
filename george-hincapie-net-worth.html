However, on October 10, 2012, he released a statement in his website admitting the use of performance-enhancing drugs. He also confirmed that he had been approached by the US Federal Investigators and USADA on the subject of his doping.

This also included the stripping of all race results between May 31, 2004 and July 31, 2006.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGSutbTLnqueq1%2BcsrC%2Bxp5koaGemK6xtcRmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
