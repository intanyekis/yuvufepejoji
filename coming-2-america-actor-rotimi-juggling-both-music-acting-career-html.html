Rotimi&nbsp;shared&nbsp;the post after the lockdown was officially removed in the USA, and the movie shoots had just begun after the pandemic. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The fans seemed happy seeing their icon back to shooting as they flooded the&nbsp;comments section&nbsp;with positive responses. One of the top comments read, “You are on the right path, hard work pays off! Much success to you Ro ðŸ‘” while another individual commented, “Multitasker.”</p><p>The post was&nbsp;uploaded&nbsp;during his birthday month, November, so his followers also commented several birthday wishes and congratulated him for the success.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Moreover, in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quarantine interview</a>&nbsp;with Hot 97 in May 2020, Rotimi talked about proving himself in the music industry along with some acting tips. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Rotimi has made a huge mark in the&nbsp;acting world&nbsp;with a variety of roles throughout his career. When asked how hard it was to get people to take him seriously as a singer as much as they do him as an actor, the Power actor replied it used to be difficult for people to differentiate him between an actor and a singer but not anymore. Rotimi further explained that the numbers don’t lie as the song views and stream counts globally have been an immense success.</p><p>His song ‘Love Rhythm’ globally did a hundred million streams, and its success turned the conversation of his success in both the worlds. The music matches up to the audience’s expectations, he added.</p><p>“You know it used to be, but then numbers don’t lie. Love Rhythm globally did a hundred million streams.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The talented singer also explained that many actors had tried their hands in acting, but few have been able to pull it off. So, one needs to be different to create an impact in&nbsp;both fields. Rotimi gave some examples of legendary artists like Jamie Foxx and Harry Belafonte, who are successful in both areas.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The&nbsp;True to the Game 2&nbsp;actor also cleared out the misconceptions of the people who thought he entered the music industry after working as an actor. He revealed he had been making music much before he started acting in movies.</p><p>“The thing is for me, I have always been doing music way before I started acting, so that’s the misconception.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the&nbsp;interaction, he also opened up that he always had a passion for music but is still learning to act.
