I think of what we all mean to people and how cyclical it is. We are all so infinitesimally and maximally connected and significant. It’s an honor. Thank You @beyonce 💖.”</p><p>Beyoncé made her subtle dig the same day Lizzo (real name Melissa Jefferson) was <a href=#>sued by three former dancers</a> — <strong>Arianna Davis</strong>, <strong>Crystal Williams</strong> and <strong>Noelle Rodriguez</strong> — for sexual harassment, religious harassment, disability discrimination, creating a hostile work environment and more. The suit also names Lizzo’s tour company, Big Grrrl Big Touring, Inc. (BGBT), and dance captain <strong>Shirlene Quigley</strong>.</p><p>According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly on Tuesday, the dancers alleged that Quigley made several comments about Davis’ virginity and made the group “uncomfortable” by simulating “oral sex on a banana in front of the rest of the dance cast.”</p><p>While competing on the reality competition series <a href=#>Lizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls</a>, Davis and Williams claim they were required to participate in a <a href=#>nude photo shoot</a> and feared they would be sent home if they refused. Lizzo also invited her dancers to an outing in Amsterdam’s Red Light District. The group felt “obligated” to attend due to fear of losing their jobs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Beyonce-Skips-Over-Lizzo-Name-During-Break-My-Soul-Performance-Following-Sexual-Harassment-Lawsuit-2.jpg><p>“While at Bananenbar, things quickly got out of hand. Lizzo began inviting cast members to take turns touching the nude performers, catching dildos launched from the performers’ vaginas, and eating bananas protruding from the performers’ vaginas,” the lawsuit states. “Lizzo then turned her attention to Ms. Davis and began pressuring Ms. Davis to touch the breasts of one of the nude women performing at the club.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Other allegations include dancers <a href=#>not being allowed to work other jobs</a> while on break from tour, Davis being fired after allegedly filming a dance team meeting and Lizzo acting “aggressively” toward Rodriguez after she confronted the singer about Davis and Williams’ firings.</p><p>“The stunning nature of how Lizzo and her management team treated their performers seems to go against everything Lizzo stands for publicly, while privately she weight-shames her dancers and demeans them in ways that are not only illegal but absolutely demoralizing,” attorney <strong>Ron Zambrano</strong> in a statement on Tuesday. Lizzo has yet to publicly address the lawsuit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmesZ%2BjsKZ50qSgqatdpMOmvoyloLOyn6h6r63MnmSdraKeu6h5waucmqNdosZuv86uo2aolaezsL7MmqWcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
