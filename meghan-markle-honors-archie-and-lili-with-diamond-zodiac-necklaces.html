Meghan Markle released a special (and pretty comical video) with Melissa McCarthy in honor of her 40th birthday and it quickly became clear that she was keeping her kids close for her big day. 
For the video appearance, the Suits star wore two gorgeous necklaces with son Archie and daughter Lili’s zodiac signs. Designed by LA-based jewelry designer Logan Hollowell, the Taurus Constellation Necklace was a sweet shoutout to son Archie, who was born in May 6, 2019, and the Gemini Constellation Necklace honored daughter Lilibet, who was born on June 4, 2021."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Designed by LA-based jewelry designer <strong>Logan Hollowell</strong>, the Taurus Constellation Necklace was a sweet shoutout to son Archie, who was born in May 6, 2019, and the Gemini Constellation Necklace honored daughter Lilibet, who was born on June 4, 2021.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The sweet necklaces come with a pretty big price tag, too. The Gemini necklace, which features 11 diamonds and has a weight of 0.42 carats, is worth $1,785. The Taurus design, which has eight diamonds that weigh a total of 0.4 carats, totals at $1,600.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Markle let the necklaces shine front and center, keeping the rest of her look neutral and laid back. She wore a ribbed cream tank top, cream cardigan and suede camel-colored pumps. As for her glam? Her hair was styled in a loose bun and her makeup was kept on the softer side.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The royal was all smiles in the clip — and it’s likely thanks to McCarthy’s hysterical birthday to-do list.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The Bridesmaids star even went so far to suggest that the two get matching tattoos, flashing a drawing of the duo side-by-side with the text: “Besties Forever.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“Well you know I already have something very similar on my back,” Markle joked. “You know, maybe we save it for when I turn 50.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Meghan-Markle-Honors-Archie-and-Lili-by-Wearing-Diamond-Necklace-With-Their-Star-Signs-Prince-Harry.jpg><p class=p1>Other ideas included a Suits reunion, a zen looking photo shoot or a yacht party.
