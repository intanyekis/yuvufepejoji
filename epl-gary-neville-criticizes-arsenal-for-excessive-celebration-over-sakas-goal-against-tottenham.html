Saka confidently placed his penalty shot down the middle of the goal, just out of reach of diving Guglielmo Vicario.
The 22-year-old player and his teammates, overwhelmed with excitement, celebrated vigorously at Emirates Stadium.
Unfortunately, their elation was short-lived when Tottenham swiftly responded with a goal, as James Maddison assisted Son Heung-min for his second goal of the match, ultimately resulting in a 2-2 draw."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They conceded right away from the kick-off. I don’t think it was the right time to excessively celebrate in that corner; they should have quickly returned to the halfway line and recognized that the game was far from over. Son’s finish was brilliant,” he added.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmicqaRdnK6zxYynnK%2BhnKGybq%2FRoquim5mvsrR5wKuqnqaRoXqnu9FmnLGblajAqsLEZpqepJWXv6LAyKilZqemmr9uv8CkmKxll6SurXnAoJiipqOperW7062cp6CRonw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
