At the time, Aaron was the quarterback for the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Green Bay Packers</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Right, right, and if parachutes are so great, how come 11 people died skydiving last year?” the host said on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jimmy Kimmel Live! </a>in November 2021 in response to Aaron’s comments about the vaccine on The Pat McAfee Show. “The fact of the matter is the risk of dying from Covid is 11 times higher if you aren’t vaccinated. This is a dumb conversation, but you’ll never guess who this wack Packer has been getting his medical advice from,” Jimmy added, in reference to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joe Rogan</strong></a>, who had Aaron on his podcast to discuss the vaccine.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Honestly, the only thing worse than not getting vaccinated when you’re in close contact with other people is letting them think you’re vaccinated when you’re not,” Jimmy also said about Aaron. “It’s basically the Covid equivalent of ‘the condom fell off.’ Aaron is a Karen, that’s the fact of the matter.”</p><h2>March 2023: Jimmy Calls Aaron a ‘Wack Packer’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Aaron first talked about the alleged list of people associated with Epstein during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show&nbsp;in March 2023. Jimmy<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> responded</a> to Aaron’s conspiracy theory comments on his talk show and made fun of the famous athlete.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Needless to say, all this UFO talk has the tin foil hatters going wild, including whack-Packer Aaron Rodgers,” Jimmy said, adding, “It might be time to revisit that concussion protocol, Aaron.”</p><h2>January 2024:</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>When Aaron appeared on The Pat McAfee Show&nbsp;again on January 2, 2024, he outright mentioned Jimmy as one of the high-profile names who will be on the list of people who have alleged ties to Epstein. “A lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, are hoping that doesn’t come out,” Aaron <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said</a> on the show.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dear Aasshole: for the record, I’ve not met, flown with, visited, or had any contact whatsoever with Epstein, nor will you find my name on any “list” other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can’t seem to distinguish from reality.

Your reckless words put my family in danger. Keep it up and we will debate the facts further in court.@AaronRodgers12,” Jimmy tweeted.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>Pat McAfee</strong> even apologized for “being a part” of Aaron’s statement against Jimmy, noting that the former athlete was “just trying to talk s**t.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“I can see exactly why Jimmy Kimmel felt the way he felt, especially with his position. But I think Aaron was just trying to talk s**t,” Pat said after the argument went viral. “But did it go too far? Jimmy Kimmel certainly said that was the case. We obviously don’t like the fact that we’re associated with anything negative ever. We like our show to be an uplifting one, a happy one, a fun one. But it’s because we talk shit and try to make light of everything. Some things obviously people get very pissed off about, especially when they’re that serious allegations, so we apologize for being a part of it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mipKaxXaC2rrnEpWSamaKku26%2Bzp2enqqjYrOmwcNmq6KllaG2r7GMbmlqb2lqhXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
