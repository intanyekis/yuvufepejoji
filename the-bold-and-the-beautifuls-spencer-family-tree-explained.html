He made an instant impact, carrying out his father's dying wish to exact revenge on the Forrester family. Throughout Bill's time on "Bold," viewers have seen him involved with many women, namely Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood), Brooke Logan, and Katie Logan. His inability to choose between the two Logan sisters has wreaked havoc on everyone's lives, with Bill returning to Katie after being rejected by Brooke, who believes her destiny is with Ridge Forrester (via <a href=#>Soaps In Depth</a>).</p><p>Bill, like his father, has also proved that he will do whatever it takes to succeed in business. Some of his past inexcusable actions include blowing up the Spectra Fashions building, leaving his son, Liam Spencer, and Sally Spectra (Courtney Hope) in the rubble, nearly killing them. However, as ruthless as Bill might be in the corporate sphere, he's almost more nefarious in his personal life. He cheated on his ex-wife Katie with multiple women, including her sister, Brooke, and his son's wife, Steffy. If that wasn't horrific enough, Bill thought at one point that he was the father of his daughter-in-law's unborn child (via <a href=#>Michael Fairman TV</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, Bill has tried taking a lighter approach, but it's failing. His sword necklace is back on, and he's ready to go low to get anything and everything he wants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kGpqcWtpany1tMRmmaiklGKur7CMrZ%2BeZZKarrbAyJ%2BspatdqL2musKeqWaekaK2rcWMramenV2axbG4wKKlnpxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
