During the WWE Survivor Series post-show press conference, Triple H was asked about working with Ozzy Osbourne for WWE Survivor Series: War Games. Osbourne’s “War Pigs” (originally performed with Black Sabbath) was one of the themes used for the event, and he was also shown in the intro montage. Triple H spoke about the relationship WWE has with the rock legend and said it was a relationship that just works."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Osbourne’s “War Pigs” (originally performed with Black Sabbath) was one of the themes used for the event, and he was also shown in the intro montage. Triple H spoke about the relationship WWE has with the rock legend and said it was a relationship that just works.</p><p>“I called him. [laughs] We called Ozzy. I couldn’t understand a word he said, so we talked to Sharon. Ozzy, as you know, Hall of Famer, icon, just means so much, and War Pigs is such a classic song that fits with WarGames incredibly well. He’s always up to doing stuff with us, whenever we call him. He had an album out, it was great to promote his album. It was great for us.”</p><p>Triple H went on to note that the two sides discussed having Ozzy Osbourne perform at one point, but the timing wasn’t right.</p><p>“At one point in time, we were talking about him performing here today. Just timing wasn’t right, and the moment wasn’t right. But I think we Ozzy, we love Sharon, we love what we’ve done with them over the years. We look forward to doing more together, and it was a blast to see him in the open of the show tonight. What’s cooler than having Ozzy say, ‘Welcome to WarGames’, with the Prince of Darkness laugh after it? It just fits.”</p><p>Ozzy Osbourne’s song “Parasite” was the primary theme song for this year’s Survivor Series event. “War Pigs” was used for one other War Games event, as it was the theme for NXT Takeover: WarGames in 2020. Osbourne was a Celebrity Inductee in the WWE Hall of Fame’s Class of 2021. In addition to his Survivor Series contributions, Ozzy has also appeared at WrestleMania 2. He has also made several guest appearances on WWE RAW in recent years.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJsaHBoYGLEuLGMnaCsm6WowKawjKGYr6GenHqwxtmyZKirkqTCs7rEZqeeqpakv655wK1ksK%2BVYsC2vtWiraiqXaiys7XErGSwmaJitKK5xKw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
