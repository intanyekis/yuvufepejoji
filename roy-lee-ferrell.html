He married Betty Kay Ferrell (born October 9, 1940), an elementary school teacher. The two have kept their first meeting a secret. On October 28, 1964, after a few years of dating, the pair kissed and pronounced each other husband and wife. For many years, the lovebirds had lived happily and without incident. But something happened in Roy and Betty’s lives in 1975 that changed their relationship and, of course, their lives. As a result, the husband and wife couple divorced without mentioning the cause. It is unknown if Roy remarried following his divorce from Betty Kay. He may, on the other hand, be living a peaceful and happy retired life in Los Angeles, away from the spotlight.</p><h2><span id=Roy_Lee_Ferrell_is_the_father_of_two_sons>Roy Lee Ferrell is the father of two sons</span></h2><p>Roy Lee and his ex-wife are the proud parents of two sons.
