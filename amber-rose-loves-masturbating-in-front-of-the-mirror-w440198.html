Because who wants to risk having their sex tape leaked?</span></p><p>“Masturbate in front of the mirror,” she told Chyna, 28, and sex therapist <b>Dr. Chris Donaghue</b>. “I’m the queen of that. … I highly suggest it, by the way. Just go home and masturbate in the mirror. It’s f–king amazing. You should try it.”</p><p><span>Despite her NSFW hobby, the stripper turned TV personality revealed that she isn’t as sex-crazed as fans might think. In fact, the mom of one — she shares son Sebastian, 3, with ex-husband </span><b>Wiz Khalifa</b><span> — says she can go a year without getting busy in the bedroom if she isn’t in a committed relationship.</span></p><p>“I have gone a year,” Rose, whose most famous ex is <b>Kanye West</b>, explained. “If I’m not in a relationship — like I’m not in a relationship now — I don’t feel the need to go out and find someone to have sex with. I don’t feel an urge.”</p><p><span>While she may not feel an urge to hit the sack with a special someone on a regular basis, the model recently curbed her curiosity by trying out a threesome — an experience that she deeply regretted.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p><span>“We kinda just got together. It was a guy and a girl and it was f‑‑king horrible,” Rose admitted on last week’s edition of her podcast. “It was the worst. I am literally having sleepless nights.… I felt the pressure, getting older, to experience new things and I did it against my better judgment because I talk about sex a lot.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav26%2BzqycZqSfq7K0ecyaqq2topeutbXNoGSipl2bv7C602amn2WknbJuucirqaiqXayBdXyQcm9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
