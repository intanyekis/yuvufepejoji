Like the one of <a href=# rel=noopener>Tempestt Bledsoe</a>, who has been dating her boyfriend since the year 1993. Her boyfriend happens to be none other than <strong>Darryl M.Bell</strong>. Just like Tempestt, Daryll is also an actor as well as a producer. This couple met in the year of 1989 for the first time and they began dating since 1993. They have been inseparable&nbsp;ever since.</p><p>They also appeared as a couple in reality TV show called House Husbands of Hollywood&nbsp;in 2009.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BD_x2M0D-cn/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><p><strong>Caption: Tempestt Bledsoe with her boyfriend Darryl Bell&nbsp;</strong></p><p>What really glues them together even after all this time is the respect they have for each other. Bledsoe has a lot of good stuff&nbsp;to say about her boyfriend. Upon being asked about her boyfriend during the start of the show, she said,</p><p>“I hope people will get past the title and see what these men are doing: pursuing their careers, taking care of their children. I have nothing but respect for that.”</p><p>They both seem committed enough without actually getting committed. From the above statement, we feel like they even have kids together but this secretive couple has never been spotted together with any children.</p><p>It looks like there is still time for Tempestt to be dropping the marriage bomb and calling Darryl her husband. We wish they will redefine the meaning of forever.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tempestt_Bledsoe_a_short_bio_More_of_her_wiki_facts_Tv_shows_movies_and_net_worth></span>Tempestt Bledsoe, a short bio; More of her wiki facts, Tv shows, movies, and net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tempestt Bledsoe has her birth date on 1st of August, 1973.
