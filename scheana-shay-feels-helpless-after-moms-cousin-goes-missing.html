“My mom and I are here in London right now feeling helpless,” the Vanderpump Rules star, 34, said in an Instagram Stories video on Friday, February 28. “I posted yesterday that her cousin’s been missing and he still is. We haven’t found anything. There were a couple updates the day before yesterday — a few sightings around Mission Grove and Bathurst [Road] and in, like, a Sprouts shopping center parking lot, but we still haven’t found him, so anyone in the Riverside area, please keep your eyes out."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He is 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds, and was wearing tan khaki pants when he disappeared. Tate is diabetic and has dementia.</p><p>“He is not from the area so he will definitely be confused and disoriented,” Shay’s mother, Erika van Olphen, wrote via Instagram Stories on Thursday, February 27, explaining that Tate “was visiting his mother-in-law” at Westmont Village.</p><p>Van Olphen later announced that a missing person was filed with the Riverside Sheriff’s Department and that the California Highway Patrol issued a Silver Alert. She said that local churches, homeless shelters, hospitals and parks have all been searched by authorities and loved ones.</p><p>“I will continue to report this all on here because the power of social media is SO insane,” the Bravo personality’s mom wrote. “I never know who might see this and be able to provide ANY information to help.”</p><p>In another post later on Friday, van Olphen added, “We are still searching!!!
