Back in the ‘90s and early ‘00s, we all pretty much had the same things on our wish lists. Tattoo chokers, inflatable furniture, holographic tops, oversized scrunchies, overalls and a healthy amount of velvet and flannel. You know the vibes. Shoe-wise, we went from our light-up sneakers to combat boots, and when the warmer weather rolled around, we all had our Steve Madden platform sandals ready to go."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Tattoo chokers, inflatable furniture, holographic tops, oversized scrunchies, overalls and a healthy amount of velvet and flannel. You know the vibes. Shoe-wise, we went from our light-up <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> to combat boots, and when the warmer weather rolled around, we all had our <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steve Madden platform sandals</a> ready to go. That, or we were too young to buy them and our parents refused. Either way, they were epic!</p><p>These <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steve Madden signature shoes</a> were first introduced in 1994, and they held their ground as a top trend for years, seen on celebrities and shoppers like Us alike. We’ve missed them so much as the years have passed by, but recently, they finally reemerged from their deep sleep. The Slinky30 Sandal is delivering those ‘90s/’00s vibes like never before, and even modern celebs like <strong>Camila Cabello</strong> have been spotted in them!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steve-madden-slinky-90s-sandal-platform.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steve Madden Slinky30 Sandal</a> (originally $80) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$50</a> at Zappos with free shipping!</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">These nostalgia-drenched sandals</a>&nbsp;are 37% off at Zappos right now and we can barely contain our excitement. We’re about to scream like we’re front row at an *NSYNC concert or even like Rachel just got off the plane. Reviewers are just as excited, pumped to have found “the closest re-master to the original” shoe that you can get. They say they’re “living in these” and that they’re “so comfy.” And yes, you can still hear that familiar “thwack” sound when you strut your stuff in them!</p><p>The all-black shade was always the real OG with this style sandal, and that’s exactly what we have here. These slides have an open toe and heel, a wide, soft band stretching across the top of the foot and a cushioned footbed just below. Under that, of course, is the chunky 2 ½-inch heel and platform, finished off with a textured outsole for traction!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steve-madden-slinky-90s-sandal-upper.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steve Madden Slinky30 Sandal</a> (originally $80) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$50</a> at Zappos with free shipping!</strong></p><p>‘90s lovers know this Italian-made shoe is the true footwear icon of the decade, simply made for shopping around for graphic tees Limited Too or picking up the newest roller lip gloss at Claire’s. Of course, these days, you’ll be wearing them to different stores — though lip gloss is still a must — but you can still incorporate numerous vintage elements into your look for a retro-modern hybrid combination that’s going to draw in compliments like a magnet.</p><p>Try wearing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these sandals</a> with acid-wash straight leg jeans and an oversized button-up top, a silky scrunchy in your hair or maybe a bucket hat on your head — another top fashion trend that recently reemerged. You could also pair them with biker shorts and a crop top, a belt bag around your waist or over your shoulder. Or how about with a satin slip dress? Now that outfit would be da bomb!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steve Madden Slinky30 Sandal</a> (originally $80) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$50</a> at Zappos with free shipping!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
