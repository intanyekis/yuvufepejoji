The two had been together for less than two years when Benjamin popped the question.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bella-Thorne-Floral-Bikini-Neon-Boots-SplashNews-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>At the end of April, the lovebirds <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebrated their engagement</a> with a party, where they were joined by their friends and family members. Bella looked absolutely amazing at the bash, where she wore a red dress that had a thigh-high slit. She paired the gown with red shoes to match. As she and Benjamin headed into the party, they packed on the PDA for the paparazzi cameras that were waiting for them outside.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Bella has been in quite a number of high-profile, public relationships, but it looks like she’s finally found the man she’s ready to settle down with! So far, the former Disney star has not shared any of her wedding plans, so fans are anxiously waiting to see when she will walk down the aisle. Either way, it clearly seems like hot girl summer will be in full effect for the 23-year-old based on her latest post!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49rZpudnKGubsDHqKmnnV2Xtqy1zaJkm6efqcBuv9SmpJ6qXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
