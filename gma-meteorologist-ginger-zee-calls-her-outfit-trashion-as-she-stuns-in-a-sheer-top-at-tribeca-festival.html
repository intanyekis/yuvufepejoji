She labeled the outfit “trashion”, explaining the materials used to make the whole ensemble. The chief meteorologist from ABC attended the festival in a sheer top that exposed her black bra.&nbsp;</p><p>Zee has been advocating for sustainable fashion both professionally and off-screen through social media. The show host started her journey with a summer challenge and decided to not buy any new clothes in over a year.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Ginger Zee talks 'trashion'</h2><p>Zee gave the lowdown about her outfit on a TikTok video. She called it “trashion”, which is a play on the words “trash” and “fashion”. The GMA host mentioned that the fashion designer behind the look was Anna Molinari, who exclusively works within the limits of sustainable fashion, which is right up Zee’s alley.&nbsp;</p><p>In the video, Zee showed off her top and skirt combo along with the accessories which were all made by recycling scraps and trash. The bracelet she was sporting was made up of soda can tabs tied together while her sheer top was made up of cloth scraps and extra sail line.&nbsp;</p><p>Zee called designer Molinari a “soul sister” for using everything and wasting nothing. Previously, the designer made a whole dress out of soda can tabs and she often experiments with waste material to create interesting clothing.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Ginger Zee’s sustainable fashion journey</h2><p>Zee is known both for being extremely stylish and also being dedicated to climate change in the context of sustainable fashion. Recently, Zee posted another TikTok video in which she revealed that her popular GMA outfits were often right from her closet or rented, and never newly-bought.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, the GMA weather reporter joined the "No New Clothes" challenge and since then, has not spent money on a single piece of new clothing. She promotes upcycling, repeating outfits, thrifting and renting as much as possible to lower the alarming consumption of clothes which results in the generation of huge amounts of waste.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRon52Weq6x056mq6ecpLSqv9NmnqKml5q%2FbsbEnmScmZyhwG60xKtkqK2km7a1edOrmKygmaS7bq3SZqqhnV2owba60magp2WRYsCpscSrZK2noGKutXnTq6CbnZOWeqex0q2gr5mc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
