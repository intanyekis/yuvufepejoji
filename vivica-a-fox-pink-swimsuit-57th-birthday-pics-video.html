In one clip, she was jumping up and down with her adorable goddaughter, <strong>Iman Joelle</strong>, who was rocking her own pink dress, in the fashionable bathing suit and looked as happy as could be. Other pics and videos showed all her guests sharing memories with her and celebrating her being another year older while hanging by a pool and enjoying good food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vivica-A-Fox-Pink-Swimsuit-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6><span title=Edited>“GM Dawlings! #SatSmiles&nbsp;as I kicked off my&nbsp;#LEONATION Bday celebrations w da LA SQUAD!” Vivica wrote in the caption for the post before tagging guests and brands who were a part of her big day. “ACTUAL BDAY IS JULY 30TH!

Her fans were quick to share their excitement about the epic post she shared by responding with compliments. “Gorgeous!!!” one fan exclaimed while another called the pictures “beautiful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>This isn’t the first time Vivica has wowed us with her beauty. The talented star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made headlines</a> back in Dec. when she was photographed having fun on a vacation in Mexico while wearing a colorful one-piece swimsuit. She paired it with a white sun hat and sunglasses and looked as pretty as could be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FxZq%2Bhpp6wonnAZp2osF2ltq%2B3jKyuoqWjqra1eZRwq6Flkp6%2FtbTDmrBmqJmYwG7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
