Olivia Gets Some Sexual Healing
Look, there’s no denying that Olivia (Kerry Washington) has been in a rut ever since that whole “being kidnapped” thing happened a few weeks ago (to quote Sue, she’s a “dried up prude”)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The good news is that Olivia finally stepped into a LBD for some good ol’ fashioned sexual healing! Unfortunately, her first night back in action went from titillating to terrifying thanks to PTSD, but by the end of the episode Olivia was hooking up with a major hottie. We’ll drink a giant glass of wine to that!</p><p><strong>Leo Bergen Is “The DustBuster!”</strong></p><p>Prepare to be shocked: one of the main kink-enthusiasts in Sue’s book was none other than Leo Bergen (<strong>Paul Adelstein</strong>), whom you might remember as Abby’s (<strong>Darby Stanchfield</strong>) professional fixer boyfriend — aka the guy version of Olivia. Apparently Leo’s into something called “DustBusting,” and while we’re not quite sure what that is, the fact that Abby made Olivia turn away from her while using this gasp-inducing phrase makes it obvious that she had some firsthand experience…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Riding On That Surfboardt</strong></p><p>Olivia wasn’t the only Gladiator to hook up this week! Abby most definitely got her DustBuster on at the end of the episode, and highlights include her cooing “get down to the kitchen, get your clothes off, get the butter” to Leo Bergen, who replied “that sounds filthy and slippery and I like it already.” Call us crazy, but these two are kind of cute in a weird, Christian Grey-esque way….</p><p><strong>Paging Doctor Love!</strong></p><p>Breaking news: David Rosen (<strong>Joshua Malina</strong>) was also featured in Sue’s salacious book — right alongside Sit-n-Spin, The Gulch, and Rough Rider. So, what was David’s code name? That would be The Doctor, and apparently he hooked up with Sue during a particularly rough time in his life. More power to you, David! In other news, Abby certainly has a type.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Huck Kills Lena Dunham (er, Sue)</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>This moment was the exact opposite of sexy, but it was certainly shocking! Huck took his typically-lovable craziness to new heights by slitting Sue’s throat so that she wouldn’t leak names from her book. But why?! Turns out this former B613 super-spy was terrified that if David Rosen (sorry, “The Doctor”) lost his job thanks to Sue’s book, he wouldn’t be able to give Huck immunity for testifying. Sounds reasonable. Or totally crazy…</p><p>Scandal airs Thursday nights at 9 P.M.
