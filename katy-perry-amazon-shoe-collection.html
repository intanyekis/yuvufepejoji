All the products from her collection are priced below $100. And each pair is perfect for specific types of occasions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Katy Perry Spends Her Millions</a></span></p><p>For instance, Perry described her Star-heeled sandal as the perfect pair of shoes for wedding guests.</p><p>“You don't want to steal the show necessarily, but why not go all out since we've been dressing in sweats? I love this shoe. I love a little PVC and a unique-shaped heel. I like PVC because I'm interested in elongating my leg and that's what this see-through [fabric] does,” she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The “Roar” singer also explained that this pair, in particular, is based on a little art deco Hollywood style.</p><p>For those who are after style and comfort, the Kerry Sneaker could be the top choice. According to Perry, this pair is all about comfort and pizazz.</p><p>The black slip-on shoes with a white thick sole are also designed with one huge daisy on top. And the daisy is adorned with crystals.</p><p>“Just so you know, I'm really particular about the crystals and stuff,” she said. Perry also guarantees that the crystals won’t fall off with every wash.</p><p>During her live Q&A on Amazon, Perry also seemingly threw a shade at another shoe brand that she refused to name. Since she’s a new mom, the singer said that she’s truly after comfort these days.</p><p>“I won’t name names, but there is a shoe designer, who is male, and supposedly their shoes are not comfortable, and supposedly they said something like heels let women stand in place and enjoy the scenery a little more. “We don’t have time to enjoy the scenery! We create the scenery!” she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, it is possible that Perry is referring to the high-end shoe designer, Christian Louboutin.</p><p>But even without the shade, Perry’s fans known as Katy Kats will definitely <a href=#>support her latest venture</a>. And her line’s success will surely add more to the singer’s <a href=#>$330 million net worth</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>10 Things Katy Perry Does To Achieve Success</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=#>E!
