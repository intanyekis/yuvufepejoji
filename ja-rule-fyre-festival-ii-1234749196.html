However, ticket holders soon found out that all that was promised was a fraud.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “festival” held in Great Exuma actually included cheap tents instead of the promised cabanas, cheese sandwiches instead of gourmet meals, and no major music acts. Guests began to complain as many of them were stranded on the island and could not return home earlier than their scheduled flights.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rule and MacFarland were quickly deemed <a href=# data-type=post data-id=631252>“con-artists” and “scammers”</a> to which the “Livin It Up” rapper immediately tried to clear his name.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In April 2017, Rule tweeted out that the failed festival was <a href=# data-type=post data-id=607434>not his fault</a> and that his only concern at the time was getting “everyone [off] the island SAFE.” He also claimed to be “heartbroken” and that he would see to it that all purchasers receive a refund.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Two years later, the chaotic event was chronicled through Netflix’s documentary FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened&nbsp;and Hulu’s&nbsp;released Fyre Fraud.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I had an amazing vision to create a festival like NO OTHER!!!” Rule tweeted out following the documentaries’ premieres. “I would NEVER SCAM or FRAUD anyone what sense does that make??? I too was hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead [sic] astray!!!.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As the “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234728099>Always On Time” rapper </a>only received backlash from fans, viewers of the doc, and those who flew out to the island, McFarland paid a greater price.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# rel=nofollow>31-year-old was arrested in 2018 </a>and served part of a six-year sentence on wire fraud charges, in connection with his involvement in the misleading event. He was released in March 2022 after serving four years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/y2p3gat1YVzXdljtHbLHfAZTm7w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/billy-mcfarland-1-086aebe019af4d679763246c8e75abd1.jpg"><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While incarcerated, McFarland <a href=# rel=nofollow>issued a statement to PEOPLE</a> apologizing for his role in the con.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I am incredibly sorry&nbsp;for my collective actions and will right the wrongs I have delivered to my family, friends, partners, associates and, you, the general public,” he wrote. “I’ve always sought — and dreamed — to accomplish incredible things by pushing the envelope to deliver for a common good, but I made many wrong and immature decisions along the way and I caused agony.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He added, “As a result, I’ve lived every day in prison with pain, and I will continue to do so until I am able to make up for some of this harm through work and actions that society finds respectable.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Sunday (April 9), McFarland tweeted out, “<a href=# id=auto-tag_fyre-festival-ii data-tag=fyre-festival-ii>Fyre Festival II</a> is finally happening.
