I hate to even namedrop, I hate to speak on this shit. But that was the scariest moment of my life when you a young artist, you trying to learn the game, you don’t really know the game, and you got an artist at the top telling you that if you don’t sign over here all or nothin’, you ain’ going to sign nowhere.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kevin Gates Talks Nearly Signing To Young Money, Being Schooled By Lil Wayne & Birdman – <a href=#>http://t.co/hgTKcG9znG</a><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xu5I3xG2zC</a></p><p>— Lil Wayne HQ (@LilWayneHQ) <a href=#>July 15, 2014</a></p><p>Thankfully, the incident seems to have motivated his grind rather than deter him in the end, thanks to <a href=#>his wife Dreka Gates</a>. “I ain’t gon’ lie,” says Gates. “It affected me cuz after that I went to the hotel and just laid down.
