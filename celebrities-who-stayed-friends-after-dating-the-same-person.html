Given their shared dating history, it would be understandable if Selena and Miley did not get along. However, earlier this year, Miley and Selena proved that they are still friends. Selena did an impression of "one of [her] oldest friends," Miley, during her SNL opening monologue. Miley then posted about the sweet shout out on her Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gigi-hadid-and-taylor-swift><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Gigi Hadid And Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>Back in 2008, Taylor Swift and Joe Jonas dated.
