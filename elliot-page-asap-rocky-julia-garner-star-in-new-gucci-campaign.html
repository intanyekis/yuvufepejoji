Last year, the brand expanded the fragrance line by introducing the Gucci Guilty Intense Pour Femme and Pour Homme.</p><p>The collaboration is especially significant for Elliot Page. This will be the first time the actor has starred in a fragrance campaign since coming out as transgender in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>I feel lucky to be writing this</a>. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life,” the Umbrella Academy actor said in a statement.</p><p>“In 2020 alone it has been reported that at least 40 transgender people have been murdered, the majority of which were Black and Latinx trans women,” he continued. “To the political leaders who work to criminalize trans health care and deny our right to exist and to all of those with a massive platform who continue to spew hostility towards the trans community: you have blood on your hands.”</p><p>Transgender visibility is increasing in the fashion and beauty industry. In 2021, Dior announced that transgender personality Jin Xing would be the face of their new perfume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The brand released a video with the hashtags #DiorStandsWithWomen and #DiorChinUp in which the Chinese celebrity discussed the importance of independence and individualism.</p><p>“ <a href=#>When I chose to become a woman</a> , to become a mother, a wife and face society anew, at the time 80 percent was worry, doubt and even contempt,” she explained.</p><p>Jin was previously a male ballet dancer as well as colonel in the Chinese army, before she became the first person in the country to undergo gender reassignment surgery in 1995.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I told myself at the time, you made the right decision but you need to give society and people time to digest and understand,” she continued. "People who previously doubted me and despised me now have evolved to like me and become my fans or people who appreciate my work.”</p><p>Dior’s campaign with Jin was met with a lot of praise and celebration, just as Elliot’s collaboration with Gucci has sparked so far.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Patrick & Brittany Mahomes Spoil Daughter With Chanel Bag On 2nd Birthday</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>MSN</a>, <a href=#>Vogue</a>, <a href=#>Yahoo</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Slo6KnpGK9orPEZpismaBiv7CvyrJko62cnq5us8CrpZ6qXajBor6MoqVmppWseqjBwpygZpuRor2itcanZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
