He is back to his normal weight now.</p><h2 id=lily-collins>Lily Collins</h2><p><a href=#>Lily Collins</a> used her strengths to portray a character she felt was important and needed to be as accurate as possible.

According to her trainer, she practiced dancing for 16 hours a day <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while only consuming coffee</a> to keep her weight down. This made her look very accurate and the same as the character she was trying to portray, and even her trainer was impressed.

The&nbsp;lack of food starts to get to you after a while and Natalie Portman said it was the toughest role she'd ever taken.</p><h2 id=zoe-kravitz>Zoe Kravitz</h2><p><a href=#>Zoe Kravitz</a> lost 20 pounds for the movie <i>The Road Within</i>, which doesn't sound like much until you understand she was down to 90 pounds after losing that weight. She was eating vegetables and running every day in order to keep her weight down. She said it was tough because of the constant lightheadedness while trying to act. Having struggled with an eating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disorder</a> in her early 20s, Zoe Kravitz took precautions and knew the risks and strategies to successfully fit this role. Although she related to weight loss in a lot of ways, she says she'd never tell anyone to lose that amount of weight in such a short amount of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-pratt>Chris Pratt</h2><p><i></i></p><p><a href=#><i>Guardians Of The Galaxy</i></a> is a classic sci-fi movie, and little do most people know, Chris Pratt lost nearly 70 pounds in six months for his role in the movie.

He exercises 3-4 times a day now and he is still in great shape.</p><h2 id=michelle-pfeiffer>Michelle Pfeiffer</h2><p>Michelle Pfeiffer said she ate only tomato soup during the filming of <i>Scarface </i>in order to continually lose weight throughout the filming of the movie. As the filming got extended further and further the crew ended up sneaking her bagels because they were worried about her. The filming went on for six weeks longer than expected and she had to be at her thinnest for the final scene. She ultimately succeeded and is surprisingly calm about the whole experience. When asked about her weight during the filming of <i>Scarface </i>she simply recounted her story and told the truth of the matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive PokÃ©mon Cards In The World</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5np5q2qLTTZphmpZmjwrWxjJycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZJ2qkaKutbXCmqOlsV2WubWx0Z6bZqSfqMFus8CipZ6cXayyqrPHrWSfp6Jiv7C4xGaYnKyZo7RutMCtn5qvka56sbTOnqWisF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
