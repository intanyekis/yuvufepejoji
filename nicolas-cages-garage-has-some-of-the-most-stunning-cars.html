The actor was paid upwards of $16 million, and he made $20 million in salary for most of his movies in the lead role. He had amassed a $150 million net worth from his films; however, his fortune has reduced to $25 million due to his spending problems. Cage spent a <a href=#>large sum to add cars to his garage</a>, and while they cost millions of dollars, his collection is enviable by all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From being a fan of Italian manufacturers like Lamborghini and Ferraris to showing his love for British cars like Jaguars and Triumph, Nicolas Cage’s collection is a true National Treasure in every way.</p><h2 id=rolls-royce-phantom-ii-coup-1935>Rolls-Royce Phantom II Coupé (1935)</h2><p>Nicolas Cage once owned nine Rolls-Royce Phantoms, but the number has now reduced.

The interior features a Louis Vuitton trunk, while the engine is a 7.7-liter six-cylinder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Garage Impossible: A Peek Inside Tom Cruise's Million-Dollar Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=bugatti-type-57c-atalante-1938>Bugatti Type 57C Atalante (1938)</h2><p>A valuable car in his collection, the Bugatti Type 57C Atalante is an extremely rare car as only 630 units were produced.
