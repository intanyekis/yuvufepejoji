Her mother is Duane’s third wife, and through her, Lyssa had two siblings: Tucker Lee Chapman and the late Barbara Katie Chapman who passed away in a tragic accident, aged 23, in 2005.</strong></p><p><strong>Lyssa Chapman has nine other half-siblings from her father’s other relationships. Through her various stints as a businesswoman, TV personality, bounty hunter, and former bail bondswoman, Lyssa now has a net worth of $500 thousand.</strong></p><p>Lyssa Chapman is the perfect example of how determination and focus can help one get their lives back on track. Popularly called ‘Baby Lyssa,’ Chapman was born into a large family with extremely busy parents and was left to figure things out on her own from a very young age.&nbsp;In 2004, she made history by becoming the youngest bondswoman in Hawaii at the age of 19.</p><p>Lyssa spent the latter part of her teenage years as a reality TV star, assisting her bounty-hunter father in capturing runaway prisoners. Later on, she took to business, writing, and charity work, in a bid to make a positive change in the world she has found herself in.&nbsp;She has also established a reputation as the most vocal, (and sometimes most controversial) Chapman sibling; if you know Lyssa, you know she doesn’t mince her words.</p><p>This has put her at loggerheads with many members of her family, but a little disagreement has never been known to stop the former reality television star anyways. If you are curious about what makes this woman so remarkable, then below is a read on facts about her that you might not have previously known.</p><h2><strong>9. Lyssa Chapman Comes From An Exceptionally Large Family and Has 12 Siblings</strong></h2><p>When you look up Lyssa Chapman, the very first thing you would learn is that she is the tenth out of twelve children. The Chapman family is one of the biggest in the world of reality television. Her father, Duane ‘Dog’ Chapman, had these twelve children with five different women, most of whom he was married to at one point or the other.</p><p>From her mother, Lyssa Rae Brittain (Big Lyssa), Lyssa has two siblings; Tucker Lee Chapman and the late Barbara Katie Chapman who passed away in a tragic accident when she was only 23, in 2005.&nbsp;The others are half-siblings born to Duane by other women.</p><p>Her other siblings’ names are Leland Chapman, Duane Lee II, Bonnie Chapman, Wesley Chapman, Zebediah ‘Zeb’ Duane Chapman (late), James Robert Chapman, Cecily Chapman, Nicholas Chapman, Garry Chapman, and Christopher Michael Hecht. The tragic passing of Barbara makes Lyssa the current oldest Chapman daughter.</p><h2><strong>8. Although She Doesn’t Have Dog’s Net Worth, Lyssa Chapman Is Wealthy Enough</strong></h2><p>The businesswoman is said to have an estimated net worth of about $500,000. A lot of her wealth is from her work as a bounty hunter and bondswoman. However, after she left the show in 2013, she went on to create more money-making channels for herself.</p><p>Lyssa also earns royalties from her autobiography, Walking on Eggshells.&nbsp;Currently, she owns multiple storefronts and a successful tanning salon and also runs an online clothing store. Lyssa might not have Dog’s kind of money, but she has done quite well already.</p><h3><strong>Lyssa Chapman Profile Summary</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Lyssa Chapman</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> Baby Lyssa</li><li><strong>Zodiac:</strong> Gemini</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 36 Years Old</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 10 June 1987</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Denver, Colorado, USA</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Education/Schools Attended: </strong>Unknown</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Businesswoman, Author, Actress</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 54 kg</li><li><strong>Height:</strong> 5 Feet 4 Inches</li><li><strong>Eye Color:</strong> Brown</li><li><strong>Hair Color:</strong> Blonde</li><li><strong>Father:</strong> Duane Chapman</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Lyssa Brittain</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Tucker Chapman, Barbara Chapman (late), Bonnie Chapman, Cecily Chapman, Leland Chapman, Duane Lee II, Wesley Chapman, Christopher Michael Hecht, Garry Chapman, Nicholas Chapman, Zeb Chapman</li><li><strong>Spouse:</strong> Brahman ‘Bo’ Galanti (m. 2009; div. 2011)</li><li><strong>Partner:</strong> Leiana Evensen (2017-date)</li><li><strong>Children:</strong> Madelyn Grace Galanti, Abbie Mae Chapman</li><li><strong>Net Worth:</strong> $500,000 (estimate)</li></ul><h2><strong>7. Lyssa Chapman’s Life Story Would Make You Tear Up</strong></h2>36-year-old Lyssa rose to fame after appearing on the reality television crime series Dog the Bounty Hunter. She was born in Denver, Colorado in the United States but moved to Alaska to live with her mother, Lyssa Rae Brittain, when she was 10. Having a famous father came with a lot of challenges for little Lyssa.<p>Her childhood was rough and tumultuous and she suffered depression, sexual abuse, and parental negligence by both parents. In a memoir about her life called Walking on Eggshells: Discovering Strength and Courage amid Chaos, Lyssa revealed that her parents were dealing with substance abuse as Duane was addicted to cocaine while Big Lyssa was an alcoholic.</p><p>When she was just 14, she got into a relationship with a man named Gerald, who was 24 at the time, and got pregnant. Lyssa had to withdraw from school and gave birth to her first daughter a day after her 15th birthday. What followed was a long period of hardship for Lyssa and her little girl; her mother abandoned her and absconded with a lover and her father had cut her off for falsely accusing him of rape.</p><p>She had nowhere to go and started living in a trailer, surviving by doing babysitting jobs in order to pay a $500 rent. Lyssa didn’t wallow in lack for too long, however, she reconciled with her father a few years later and went back to Denver.&nbsp;Before long, she became a licensed bondswoman and began appearing alongside Duane in his hit TV show. Since then, she has cleaned up very nicely and little trace is left of the traumatized teenage girl that she was in the early 2000s.</p><h2><strong>6. Baby Lyssa Became a Full-Time Business Woman after Leaving ‘Dog the Bounty Hunter’ in 2013</strong></h2><p>Lyssa Chapman is quite the businesswoman. After leaving Dog the Bounty Hunter in 2013, Lyssa wasted no time in moving on. She immediately opened a new bougie tanning salon at the Koko Marina Shopping Center in Hawaii called ‘No Tan Lines.’ It was reported that she opened the place with her business partner, Alysin Hauptner.</p><p>Apart from Lyssa, other family members have opened one business or the other in that same shopping center in Hawaii, like the retail shop Beth and Duane opened together in 2011.&nbsp;Apart from the salon, Lyssa has opened another store in the busy city, where she sells clothes and clothing accessories.</p><p>She is also an author and has written a powerful book not only to chronicle the events of her teenage life but to teach other young girls how to make better choices. In fact, she went on to create a foundation called ‘Proper Choices, Inc., a non-profit organization that she founded to connect with teen girls and teen mothers in order to help them get their lives back on track.</p><h2><strong>5. Lyssa Once Had a Public Altercation with Her Step-Mother, Beth Chapman, On Social Media</strong></h2><p>Lyssa Chapman got into a famous feud with her father’s (now late) wife, Beth Chapman, on Twitter in 2019. While it is not too surprising to learn that the two women do not get along too well, it was a very strange sight watching both of them air their dirty laundry out in the public. The fight happened after Beth went on Twitter to rant about not receiving a happy Mother’s Day call/text from Lyssa.</p><p>It was also revealed that the mother-of-two failed to invite her step-mother to her first daughter’s (Abbie) graduation that happened in Hawaii.&nbsp;Beth didn’t stop there, she went on a very long rant about how disrespectful people were to mothers, insinuating that Lyssa was being ungrateful. What made the feud so sensitive was because, at the time, Beth was battling throat cancer and had already had treatment for it once.</p><p>Beth’s sickness was public knowledge because it had been aired on their reality TV show before it went off the air in 2013. This was the reason it looked like a very wrong time for a sick person to pick a fight with her step-daughter on social media.&nbsp;In her defense, Lyssa denied refusing to invite her stepmother to her daughter’s graduation ceremony, insisting that Beth had no intention of coming to the graduation anyways.</p><p>She also posted a screenshot of a text apparently sent by Maddie, wishing Beth a happy Mother’s Day. It is, however, interesting to note that she didn’t deny blocking her stepmother. In the course of the back-and-forth, fans called Lyssa and Beth out for bringing their family problems to social media.&nbsp;It seemed like Lyssa and Beth’s bad blood is very old and extends all the way back to when Lyssa was in high school.</p><p>According to the former bondswoman, she was very miserable living with her father and his then-wife, Beth, that she left the house and went to stay with her biological mother, Big Lyssa, who had been divorced from Duane since 1991. Lyssa also mentioned that she had been assaulted by a friend of her father’s and it seemed like nothing was done about it, hence her resentment towards everyone. In recent times though, she seems to have made amends with her dad.</p><p>Her relationship with Beth, however, left a lot to be desired. On Twitter, Lyssa accused Beth of lying all in a bid to hurt her daughter and finally urged her to focus on more important things (like her health). Beth sadly passed away later that year, and it is not really clear if she and Lyssa settled their differences before she died. Whatever the case might have been, it appears Lyssa is doing just fine.</p><h2><strong>4. Lyssa Chapman Has Two Daughters with Two Different Men</strong></h2><p>When Lyssa was only 14, she experienced what she has described as “the most frightening experience of her life”. Just a day after her fifteenth birthday, she gave birth to her first daughter, Abbie Mae Chapman, on 11 June 2002, in Alaska.</p><p>Abbie Chapman attended the Sacred Hearts Academy in Hawaii and graduated in 2019, at 17. Abbie’s father, a man called Gerald, was arrested many years later after it was found out that he was 24 when Lyssa got pregnant.&nbsp;Lyssa’s second daughter named Maddelyn Galanti is a product of her first marriage.</p><p>Maddelyn was born on February 20, 2009, and is only 14 years old. Lyssa speaks about her daughters very fondly and is very protective of them as she doesn’t want them to go through what she did when she was a teenager.</p><h2><strong>3. The Former Reality Television Star Was Once Married To A Man&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Lyssa-Chapman-and-Bo-Galanti-wedding-dinner.jpg><p>Lyssa got married in February 2002 in Oahu, Hawaii, to Brahman Galanti whom she thought was the love of her life at the time. She couldn’t have been more wrong though. Brahman was allegedly abusive and was accused of beating her up.</p><p>The marriage was quite rocky and less than two years later, the two had a reportedly nasty fight after which Lyssa kicked him out of their Hawaii home and eventually filed for divorce in February 2011.&nbsp;According to Lyssa’s step-mother, Beth, Galanti had been physically assaulting Lyssa for months and she had finally decided to call it quits for good.</p><p>After their split, she had custody of their daughter, Maddelyn. The last time we saw Lyssa and Brahman together was when she drove to the airport to pick him up so that he could see Maddie – who hadn’t seen him for many years.</p><h2><strong>2. Lyssa Found Love Again, This Time In The Arms of a Woman Named Leiana Evensen</strong></h2><p>Sometimes in love, you might discover after many years that you have been backing the wrong tree all along. Lyssa definitely felt this way after meeting fitness instructor Leiana Evensen. According to several gossip reports, Leiana and Lyssa met at one of the departmental stores owned by Lyssa herself and were immediately drawn to each other when they discovered that they both had the same date of birth. How cool is that?</p><p>The two ladies kicked it off right there and bonded over ‘similar morals’ and shared interests like hiking, tanning, and general fitness activities. In 2017, during a Seattle trip together, Leiana proposed to her girlfriend and they have been inseparable since then. The two live together in Hawaii and Lyssa’s Instagram is littered with loved-up photos of her and her lover.</p><p>As far as we know, there has been no wedding yet because they believe that they are already a family and don’t need the validation of a ‘piece of paper.’</p><h2><strong>1. Baby Lyssa Once Had a Near-Fatal Accident</strong></h2><p>In 2014, Lyssa and her daughters were involved in a very serious car crash in Hawaii. Lyssa was 27 and her kids, Abbie and Maddie, were 12 and 5 respectively when it happened. According to eyewitness reports, Lyssa’s black 4-door vehicle was completely destroyed in the accident as the windows and headlights were broken into smithereens.</p><p>The airbags were also deployed, meaning that the collision had a massive impact. Thankfully, they all survived, and with minimal injuries too. Remember that Lyssa’s sister Barbara Katie had died in very similar circumstances.</p><p>She too had been involved in a fatal car accident that claimed her life when she was just 23, just a day before her father’s wedding to his fifth wife, Beth Smith.&nbsp;Lyssa has recounted the experience, saying that she had always had a nagging feeling that she would die in an accident, but was terrified for her daughters’ lives. Luckily for her, that didn’t happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC42KyqmmWTna6xucCnZKyhkqG2r7PSZpuemaSderPBzKipaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
