Martin Fitzgerald Lawrence is an American actor, comedian, writer, producer, and director that rose to superstardom in the 1990s with a vulgar, raunchy, and sarcastic style of comedy. A fun fact many of Lawrence's fans may not be aware of is his place of birth, which was in Frankfurt, Germany. This was due mainly to his father, John Lawrence, who was serving overseas in the U.S. military during the birth of the Bad Boys star. Martin would only see U.S. soil for the first time after seven years when his father moved the family back to America, settling in Maryland. Another fun fact about the comedian is that his first and middle names were inspired by the civil rights leader, <a href=#>Martin Luther King Jr.</a> as well as former U.S. President John F. (Fitzgerald) Kennedy.</p><h2 id=early-rise-of-a-comedy-king>Early Rise Of A Comedy King</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although he is remembered most notably for his own 1992 television series, Martin, the journey to his first big break came way before that. Sourced from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gazette Review</a>, Martin began doing comedy shows and other odd jobs in Washington D.C.before eventually moving to New York City in search of better connections in the film industry and, generally, just a chance to get his foot in the door. That opportunity came after performing at The Improv comedy club.</p><p>Following his acts at The Improv club, he secured a spot on the television show, Star Search. And although he was unsuccessful in graduating to the final round, his attempt was not in vain. He was fortunate enough to impress the executives at Columbia Pictures Television with his performance, which lead to being offered his first acting gig in the sitcom, What's Happening Now!! in 1985. Shortly after the show ended in 1988, he was set to be cast in<a href=#> Spike Lee's </a>1989 comedy-drama, Do The Right Thing, alongside Danny Aiello, Ruby Dee, John Turturro, and Samuel L. Jackson. Martin had finally put his foot through a crack in the door and wasn't prepared to let it close even an inch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Entering the 1990s, Lawrence had already started off with a bang. Coming off the heels of the success of his first Hollywood movie in Do The Right Thing which grossed $37.7 million at the box office, he stepped right into the next million-dollar movie franchise of his career with House Party in 1990. He would go on to reprise his role as Bilal in House Party 2 in 1991 alongside Christopher Martin, Christopher Reid, Robin Harris, <a href=#>John Witherspoon</a>, and Tisha Campbell.</p><h2 id=laughing-on-the-way-to-success>Laughing On The Way To Success</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A year late in 1992, not only did he make his debut appearance as a standup comedian on <a href=#>Russell Simmon's</a> Def Comedy Jam on HBO, but he also began airing his own televised sitcom, Martin, on Fox with one of the House Party co-stars, Tisha Campbell. During its 5-year tenure, Martin was one of Fox Network's highest-rated sitcoms, earning a People's Choice Awards for Favorite New TV Comedy series in 1993 and grossing a total of $100,000.
