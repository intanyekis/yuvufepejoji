He then sparked controversy by initially referring to the 55-year-old star as a ‘boy’ before correcting himself.</p><p>Biden, 80, remarked, ‘By the way that boy – that man’s got biceps bigger than my thighs.’</p><p>The blunder led Charlamagne to label Biden as his ‘Donkey of the Day’.</p><p>He emphasized that Biden should understand the racial implications of a white man referring to a black man as ‘boy’ in a particular context.</p><p>He stated, ‘The word ‘boy’ carries strong racial connotations when used by a white individual to address an adult Black man. I am aware of this due to my upbringing in South Carolina.’</p><p>‘When a white person uses the term ‘boy’ to refer to a Black man, it takes on a completely different meaning and context.’</p><p>The term ‘boy’ has historical implications when used by white people to denote superiority during slavery and beyond.</p><p>Charlamagne also pointed out that LL Cool J is an established artist, so there was little excuse for mispronouncing his name.</p><p>Biden introduced the rapper and fellow award recipient DJ MC Lyte as ‘two of the great artists of our time, representing the groundbreaking legacy of hip-hop in America.’</p><p>However, Charlamagne, 45, criticized Biden for his ‘inauthentic’ praise, stating, ‘It doesn’t matter how many Black people you are around or have in your administration… If it’s not authentic to him, it won’t come off as authentic to anyone.’</p><p>He also criticized the president’s age, referring to the octogenarian as ‘137 years old’ and expressed that Biden should have known there aren’t two J’s in LL Cool J’s name without needing a teleprompter.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiaoZmioa6urcannGasmJZ6qLvDZpqroaSesKrGxKxkqaqVqLalsc2tZJuhlJq7brLOq2Suq5mjtG6tjLCfoqyVYr%2Bir8isq2avn6exbrXNZqmenpWnsq%2BvxGarqGWcoXqku86lZKNn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
