She told Us that when she was in pageants she kept the number of the scale down in an unhealthy way. When she stopped doing pageants she gained weight and never quite felt content.</p><p>“I’ve struggled with my body confidence,” she told Us. “Being on TV since I was 15, you have all these people on the outside giving you their opinions on what they think you look like or you need to eat or you don’t need to eat and it truly wears on you.”</p><p>Now she decides what she wants to eat and when. But she does this not to ensure she looks good, necessarily, but instead focuses on how it makes her feel. “That’s kind of what South Beach is helping me to do. I wake up in the mornings and I feel good,” she said. “That’s the biggest thing for me. It was about feeling good on the inside and then that’s going to project on the outside.”</p><p>So how exactly is she doing that? By changing her mindset. Instead of thinking about South Beach as a diet that should produce instant results, she’s thinking of it as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lifestyle</a> that she has to adapt to.</p><p>“I still have cheat days, cheat weekends and cheat meals, but I jump back on to the South Beach diet.” This regimen combined with working out she said has delivered noticeable results like having more <a href=#>energy</a> and feeling less bloated.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s hard, but if you feel good about yourself, then no one else’s opinion matters. My dad’s always told me, ‘it’s none of your business what someone else thinks of you.’ So that’s how I look at it.” A motto we’ll be taking with Us into the summer!</p><p>Keep scrolling to see how she stays motivated, her family-favorite healthy dishes and what her favorite snacks are.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkwKLCwKelmqBdmLWztdKlnLJln6N6tbTEZqqoraSdeqOxwJyfZpyZmsFutMSao62gqWKyosDIp55o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
