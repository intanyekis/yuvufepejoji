Whitman was initially cast in the 2007 series remake of <i>The Bionic Woman,</i> playing the deaf younger sister of the title character. On June 27, 2007, <i>TV Guide</i> reported that Whitman was being replaced in the role of Jaime’s sister and Lucy Hale was cast as Whitman’s replacement the following July. An NBC spokesperson confirmed this stating, “The decision was purely creatively driven. It is very common to change storylines, characters, actors after the initial pilot is shot.” The sister character’s hearing was restored after this recasting at the request of an NBC executive. The series’ unaired pilot episode has been released on DVD on April 7, 2008.

According to co-writer and director Roland Emmerich, Whitman did not reprise her role as the President’s daughter in <i>Independence Day: Resurgence,</i> the sequel to the 1996 blockbuster hit <i>Independence Day,</i> because she did not want to read for the part. Whitman has expressed her feelings on being typecast as an outsider in various roles in television and movies. She has talked about being a child actor and her relatable experiences such as being bullied in high school for being “weird.” In an interview with Bello Mag, Whitman explains that the entertainment industry constantly tells actors what they are “not” and felt her choosing of these roles was her “trying to communicate to everyone” who may go through similar situations, that it’s okay to be who they are. One of Whitman’s more notable quotes is, “People should recognize who you are and how you can act rather than how famous you are.”</p><p>In 2018 Whitman was cast alongside Christina Hendricks and Retta on the NBC dramedy <i>Good Girls</i>. The show was renewed for a third season which premiered in the winter of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=music></span>Music<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitman has recorded “I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day” and “You Make Christmas Feel So Good” for <i>School’s Out!
