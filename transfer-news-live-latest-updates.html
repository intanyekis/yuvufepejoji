The right-winger will become the club's first player to score in their first three matches in a top-flight campaign if he hits the target again against West Ham at the Amex today.
March scored twice at Wolves last Saturday to add to a goal on the opening day at home to Luton in successive 4-1 wins for De Zerbi's side."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At the beginning of my time at Brighton I thought Solly was very important and a very big player.</p><p>"I don't know his history, but it's the same as Pascal Gross and Lewis Dunk. Sometimes I ask myself how come this player doesn't play for the big, big teams in England?</p><p>"Because I have a big, big confidence (in them). I am living with them this year and I know about their potential. Their potential is great, more than this level, but the secret of Brighton is not the coach or other things, the secret is the quality of the players.</p><p>"People don't know the level of these players so well, but I'm working with them and I know better than the people who are speaking about football."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46tqZqmo5uys3nNnq6sZZyew6Z5y5qrnqukYsKxsMCtnKxnlnqPp8C5nGebiKKgfK2ftLKFbY2YhrK1go4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
