Last season, Diddy chose two assistants, Suzanne and Mike, who no longer work for him. We’re not told why they were dismissed, but there wouldn’t be a “Work for Diddy 2” if they were still gainfully employed by him, so make your own judgments.</p><p>Diddy himself doesn’t mix much with the contestants, who include a female football player, an obsequious mall manager, several public-relations types and two women named Ebony and Ivory.</p><p>It’s Ivory who’s the in-your-face dragon lady always cast on these shows; it’s hard to tell if she’s the real deal (“I’m the queen bitch!” she announces), or was told to act this way by producers — either way, she’s completely annoying.</p><p>Diddy says in the show’s opening that he’s going to use a “Hands-on, foot-in-a**, hands-on-your-brain approach” to find his assistant, but he’s got to show up to do that; in Monday’s episode he’s noticeably absent, although there are a few fun scenes in the beginning of the show when he meets with each contestant for the first time.</p><p>The job of weeding out the weak links is left to a woman named Capricorn, herself a former Diddy assistant who’s risen to become global brand manager of his empire. She comes across as a nice woman trying to play tough, and her momentous line, “Losing is for losers,” isn’t exactly a life-altering rallying cry.</p><p>Keep your fingers crossed that Diddy finds an assistant he’ll keep this time around; sitting through a “Work for Diddy 3” doesn’t sound like a lot of fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXp7kGlmbGlflnqptdGeZKmnp5q%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
