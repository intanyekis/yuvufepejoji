She also just bought a $1.25 million home in Miami Beach, which reports say she’s going to use as an office.</p><p>Sources told <a href=#>Page Six</a> that the supermodel also purchased another home in Miami recently, though the details are under wraps. She’ll likely use the home as her main residence.</p><p>In February, Tom announced his return to the NFL only weeks after retiring. The news came after Tom had signed a 10-year, $370 million with FOX News to act as a senior football analyst.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after, reports began circulating that his decision had caused trouble in their marriage. He allegedly failed to consult the model on his decision, despite promising to step back from football to focus on their family.</p><p>Gisele later gave an interview admitting she sacrificed a lot to support her husband’s career, but she’s looking forward to focusing on herself and their children moving forward.</p><p>After Tom signed the deal with FOX, sources said that <a href=#>Gisele wanted to renegotiate their prenup</a>. However, it may have only been speculation, considering how quickly they officialised their divorce, suggesting there was little to no disagreement about the division of assets.</p><p>Reports say that <a href=#>Tom didn’t want to end the marriage</a> and tried to salvage it, but unfortunately it didn’t work out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Eric Andre Launches Lawsuit Against Police After Racial Profiling At Airport</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>Boston</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBsLmMm6manKlitKq%2FxKWcrGWZp7yvr8uam2aoopq7tryMsJisZaKarrS7zWadqKpdpsKqr8pmm6Kun6ewpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
