Life just doesn’t seem to be going the way she wants it to these days. Christina pretends to have the “flu” this episode, but really she stays at home to face the harsh reality that her husband, Owen (<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kevin McKidd</strong>)</a>, had an affair. Christina begs Owen to tell her the details, but when he finally does, she locks herself in the bathroom. After surviving her borderline manic laughing fit, Owen reveals that he cheated because he was “unsure” of where their relationship stood at that time. To understand what exactly Owen means by that, Christina brings up the big “a” word, and it doesn’t take long for her to realize that his affair was driven by her abortion. Uh oh.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Christina is understandably having a very difficult time dealing with Owen’s infidelity — even though he says it was “just sex, only once.” Owen finally packs his bags and moves out, but not without telling her that he will always love her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Christina definitely needs time alone and to think about if she is willing to forget the past and move on, but it seems like this move may be something permanent. The girls really should have changed their “ladies night out” to going to Christina’s apartment!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Surprisingly, Meredith (<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ellen Pompeo</a></strong>) admits to Derek (<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Patrick Dempsey</a></strong>) that she knows Christina isn’t really sick with the flu and that Christina is home with Owen dealing with the grueling details of his affair.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meanwhile, Mark Sloan (<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Eric Dane</a></strong>) takes over as Chief of Surgery.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>What did you think of tonight’s episode, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Do you think Christina and Owen will get back together? Or are they done for good?
