At 23, she has accomplished a lot, yet there is more to her not many are aware of.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>1. She was born in a remote fishing village in Aquiraz, Ceará, Brazil</strong>. Sampaio knew she was transgender by eight and had changed her name by 12.</p><p class=dh>She's an <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/news/2020/07/valentina-sampaio-5-fast-facts/>LGTBQ activist</a> in Brazil, which she says has a particularly harsh reception to trans people. Some reports <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/news/2020/07/valentina-sampaio-5-fast-facts/>claim</a> that the country's trans people see the most killings of trans people worldwide.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>2. She has been on the cover of several other magazines.</strong> In addition to her latest accomplishment, Sampaio has managed to add Vogue Paris, Vogue Germany, and Vogue Brasil to her portfolio already.</p><p class=dh>Furthermore, she's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/who-is-valentina-sampaio-transgender-model-brazil-3684184/>collaborated</a> with brands including H&M, Dior, Marc Jacobs, and L'Oreal Paris. One of her dreams is to make the cover of America's Vogue.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>3. She has a variety of other goals aside from modeling.</strong> Sampaio's career goals are certainly admirable, but she has other, more regular dreams.</p><p class=dh>Besides wanting to meet Ellen DeGeneres, Sampaio once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/who-is-valentina-sampaio-transgender-model-brazil-3684184/>said</a> she hopes "to marry, to have a family, [and] to have an incredible career. She certainly has the drive.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>4. Sampaio broke barriers with her Victoria's Secret runway show.</strong> Last year, Sampaio didn't just become the first transgender woman in Victoria's Secret runway show, she was the first after controversial remarks from its chief marketing officer, Ed Razek.</p><p class=dh>Razek <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/style/valentina-sampaio-first-transgender-model-victorias-secret/>said</a> he doesn't think the brand should have transgender models because it "is a fantasy." After backlash from the public, the brand issued an apology. Less than a year later, Sampaio made history.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>5. She's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/who-is-valentina-sampaio-transgender-model-brazil-3684184/>unrelated</a> to Sara Sampaio.</strong> Despite having the same last name, similar brown hair, and matching green eyes, Sampaio and fellow model Sara Sampaio are not related.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>6. She receives <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/08/valentina-sampaio/>tons of support</a> from fans and colleagues.</strong> Sampaio has been praised by fellow trans women who look up to her as well as other women who take to the runway.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>7. She was ecstatic when Sports Illustrated named her a 2020 Rookie for their July edition.</strong> "I was filled with so many emotions of happiness when I heard the news," she told <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/style/valentina-sampaio-first-transgender-model-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue/>People</a>.</p><p class=dh>Sampaio has stated her dedication to breaking down barriers so that others might follow in her footsteps without facing the same challenges. The new edition of Sports Illustrated hits stands on July 21.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Last year</a>, another Sports Illustrated first came when Halima Aden made the magazine as the first hijabi to land in an issue. The Somalian model called herself a "burkini babe" hoping to inspire others.</p><p class=dh>The historic moment saw Aden lying in water in a blue suit, head wrap, and aqua throw over. Only her hands and feet were bare. "Don't be afraid to be the first," she <a class="me a" href=#>said</a> in a promo clip for the issue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtocWpobnq3rcuepa2hnpZ6tK3MqZiip12ewG6%2Fz6ipratdnrmtwdKtqZqslZnAb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
