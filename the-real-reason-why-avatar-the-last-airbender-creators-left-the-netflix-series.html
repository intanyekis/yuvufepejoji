The excitement was particularly intense after the poor showing by Shyamalan in 2010. Sadly, things have changed for the once-promising project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Avatar creators and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix </a>recently revealed they'd be parting ways, citing "creative differences" as the reason for their split. Neither side has explicitly said what hump broke the camel's back, but FandomWire appears to have a good idea.</p><h2 id=sources-say-the-budget-is-to-blame>Sources Say The Budget Is To Blame</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/last-airbender-letterboxd.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FandomWire</a>, their inside sources at Netflix say that DiMartino and Koneitzko requested a bigger budget, which the streaming giant rejected. A reason why the showrunners needed more money is unclear, of course, the logical explanation is that the VFX, costumes, and set designs, contributed to costs they foresaw going into the project. These would be massive considering every season of Avatar: The Last Airbender took the main troupe of characters to new locations, changed their appearances multiple times over, and brought them face-to-face with a plethora of hybrid creatures. All these different factors would make a loyal adaptation of the series quite costly, so there's a valid explanation for the split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Nickelodeon Should Make Another Avatar Series</a></span></p><p>While disappointing, it's probably better the showrunners called it quits now rather than later. The reason for that is DiMartino and Koneitzko also had conflicting views on casting. The show's creators weren't arguing with each other, but rather, with the streaming service's directions.</p><p>FandomWire's sources also reported that Netflix pushed to audition actors of all nationalities—an option that the show's creators rejected. Casting actors from all walks of life is always a good thing, which should go without saying. The problem is DiMartino and Koneitzko didn't want their cast white-washed as Shyamalan did with his 2010 film. The central trio in Shyamalan's movie—who are the most integral to the story—was portrayed by Caucasian actors while actors of multiple ethnicities comprised the remaining cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch: Netflix Releases Sneak Peek Of Its Upcoming Film ‘The Sleepover’</a></span></p><p>So after witnessing a virtual "white-washing" of their characters the first time around, DiMartino and Koneitzko are justified in wanting complete control over the new cast. They could've compromised with Netflix and agreed to audition actors optioned to them, but that may have opened the door for the streaming giant to pull their weight during negotiations, giving way to terrible casting decisions.</p><h2 id=netflix-still-developing-live-action-avatar-the-last-airbender>Netflix Still Developing Live-Action Avatar: The Last Airbender</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/avatar-NAG.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As problematic as all that seems, the Netflix adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender is still moving forward. A spokesperson for the streamer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> that "[they] are confident in the creative team and their adaptation," confirming the project's continued development. Nickelodeon and producer Dan Lin are now in charge of the live-action adaptation, although there's one change that has everyone concerned.</p><p>The initial report from FandomWire indicates that Netflix wants to age up the Aang, Katara, and Sokka characters. How old they want the trio is unknown, though based on Netflix's current trend of YA dramas, it's safe to say the streamer is going with a group of young adults over children.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Must-Watch Netflix Shows If You Enjoyed Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Assuming that's the case, the upcoming adaptation will likely feature a cast, not unlike that of <a href=#>The Umbrella Academy</a>; Netflix could even borrow an actor or two from the series. They won't bring everyone from the show over, but Ritu Arya, who plays Lila on the Netflix Original, has a good shot at being cast as Katara. She's in the correct age range if Netflix chooses to go with young adults over teens, and Arya has already proven that she has acting chops to hang with the best. Though the question remains: Who will Netflix cast now that DiMartino and Koneitzko have left their Avatar adaptation?</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avatar: The Last Airbender Characters Ranked By Strength</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6uLTYZpivmaSWv27Ax55kpZmjqXqitdGbnKeclad6pL7EmquoqqNiuaay02aroZ1do7K1ssuir2arlae2pr%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
