Back in 2021, Cuoco was navigating a rather <a href=#>challenging divorce from her now ex-husband, Karl Cook</a>, with whom she had tied the knot in June 2018.</p><p>Curiously, though they seemed completely enamored with each other, <a href=#>the two waited a full two years after their wedding before cohabiting</a>. So, did the unconventional living arrangements contribute to their divorce?</p><h2 id=when-did-kaley-cuoco-and-her-ex-husband-karl-cook-file-for-divorce>When Did Kaley Cuoco And Her Ex-Husband Karl Cook File For Divorce?</h2><p>Kaley Cuoco and her ex-husband Karl Cook's years-long romance and subsequent marriage were truly a joy to behold. The two seemed completely enamored with each other, with Cuoco frequently gushing about the renowned equestrian in interviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He is my perfect match," she shared with People in 2018. "He lets me wake up in the morning and say, 'I want to go and rescue rabbits.' We are the same, our views are the same, our morals are the same, he is my perfect match."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cook-and-cuoco.jpg><p>Sadly, the duo's marriage didn't manage to stand the test of time, unraveling after just three years.</p><p>"Despite a deep love and respect for one another, we have realized that our current paths have taken us in opposite directions," the former couple shared in a media statement announcing their divorce back in September 2021. "We have both shared so much of our journey publicly so while we would prefer to keep this aspect of our personal life private, we wanted to be forthcoming in our truth together. There is no anger or animosity, quite the contrary."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though unexpected, the divorce was mutually agreed upon. "We have made this decision together through an immense amount of respect and consideration for one another and request that you do the same in understanding that we will not be sharing any additional details or commenting further," the duo shared in their joint media statement.</p><h2 id=kaley-cuoco-and-karl-cook-were-living-separate-lives-before-their-divorce>Kaley Cuoco And Karl Cook Were Living Separate Lives Before Their Divorce</h2><p>Curiously, Cuoco and Cook had only lived together for a year before their marriage imploded. During an appearance on Brad Goreski's Brad Behavior podcast, Cuoco couldn't help but rave about their unconventional relationship, claiming that their unique living situation was a perfect fit.</p><p>"I have the best relationship with Karl. We are so happy and yes, we have separate lives and then our lives come together and he's so supportive of me.

"We decided early on…I've moved in with guys before. I didn't want to do it right away, and he was like great. We've kind of been in separate places but as people see, we're together all the time,” Cuoco revealed.</p><p>“But we've had separate locations and whether that's helped us mentally or not, I've obviously never been in a better relationship and I want this to last the rest of my life so in a way, we're actually taking it slow," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We've been together for almost four years.

We're totally ready, you know," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuoco shared with US Weekly at the time</a>. "We do both travel a lot, which I think is very healthy.

It's basically a growing apart and each pursuing separate interests," the insider shared. "She has a lot going on in her career now and loves her work. Their relationship is just following different paths.
