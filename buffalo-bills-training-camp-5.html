And with the day, there was one notable absence on the field, though it wasn’t a player.</p><p>Bills coach Sean McDermott was not in attendance for the team’s practice on Day 6. A team spokesman said McDermott was attending a personal family matter, and the expectation was for the coach to rejoin the team Tuesday afternoon.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Even without McDermott, his defense put together one of its strongest efforts in training camp. Along with a brief scare about the franchise quarterback, here’s what stood out from Tuesday’s practice.</p><h2><a href=#>Josh Allen</a> has minor injury scare but misses minimal time during defensive sackfest</h2><p>For the second day in a row, there was a momentary scare for franchise quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9zLTUSPpy6pFa4xs href=#>Josh Allen</a>. On Monday, it was accidental contact from nickel corner <a class=ath_autolink data-id=THRHImglX9Xn1F4s href=#>Taron Johnson</a> that knocked over Allen at the end of practice, only for the quarterback to appear OK in the post-practice activities. And then Tuesday, Allen missed only a couple of reps. On only his second set of team drills, Allen dropped back to pass as the entire defensive line engulfed the pocket. The throw was whistled dead for a would-be sack, and Allen immediately jogged away from the area while a backup quarterback took his place in the huddle.</p><p>Allen took his helmet off as an athletic trainer came over to check on him, where both began looking at his lower right leg and foot area. General manager Brandon Beane also came to chat with Allen, with the conversation eventually appearing jovial with a laugh by the end of it. Once team drills moved on to effectively a walk-through period of installation, Allen resumed practice, then subbed out for a play as he took his right shoe off and appeared to get it taped. Without delay, Allen returned for the following play and didn’t miss a designated rep for the rest of practice.</p><p>However, even as Allen finished out the day, it was one of the more frustrating practices for the offense as the defense was consistently in the backfield, impacting the outcome. The first-team defense wound up with six would-be sacks on only 25 dropbacks, and on some of the pass attempts, Allen had to settle for a shorter throw because the pressure got there quickly. After three good days of offensive success, the defense battled back to win the day at the line of scrimmage, and then dominated the final portion of practice, as well.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>One-minute drill to end practice was a complete offensive failure</h2><p>Although the offense had its moments on Day 6, none occurred during the final stage of Tuesday’s practice. The Bills gave both the first-team and second-team offense an opportunity to operate a one-minute drill. Allen and the first-team unit started with only 40 seconds to play on their own 45-yard line. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Tl3YnI26MAjKLnzb href=#>Kyle Allen</a> and the second team took the ball at the defense’s 40-yard line with 50 seconds to play. As it turned out, it didn’t matter where each unit started its drive or how much time it had. The first and second offenses went a combined 0-for-8 with two false start penalties, one sack, two turnovers on downs and a net yardage of minus-16.</p><p>It wasn’t just misfire after misfire for the offense, though. The first-team defense saw two excellent plays in coverage to break up passes at the last minute. The first came from linebacker <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZRj4di17FE6yBxBv href=#>Matt Milano</a>, who ran stride for stride with rookie tight end <a class=ath_autolink data-id=uhpF8rWM5PhxEUD1 href=#>Dalton Kincaid</a> before breaking up the catch attempt along the right sideline. Then on fourth down, safety <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MFElwUfdcWQSPO19 href=#>Cam Lewis</a> made up for fellow safety <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1cFU1KsbzThpWD9a href=#>Taylor Rapp</a>’s poor angle to the throw and made an outstanding pass breakup deep over the middle against receiver <a class=ath_autolink data-id=AUksgZov8jpvh7HT href=#>Khalil Shakir</a>. The second-team defense saw <a class=ath_autolink data-id=j0maTHM8YBIPSMBQ href=#>Christian Benford</a>’s play instincts nearly pick off a Kyle Allen pass, and defensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink data-id=QKyjJqto39y1JrKF href=#>Kendal Vickers</a> worked in for a sack on the second play. Especially going into a day off, the offense will likely have a lot of motivation to fire back Thursday for Day 7.</p><h2><a class=ath_autolink data-id=gw2IWw46zk6HdrZ9 href=#>Baylon Spector</a> gets skipped in the rotation, though there could be a reason</h2><p>Through the first three days of camp, the Bills gave <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZxgTwYMjUwbrPqXE href=#>Tyrel Dodson</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Bgkdhz03M4GzlbZk href=#>Terrel Bernard</a> and Baylon Spector — in that order — their own day to work as the first-team middle linebacker alongside Milano. The rotation turned over on Day 4, with Dodson getting his next day with the top unit, and then Bernard on Day 5. If the same rotation held, Day 6 should have belonged to Spector. However, as the day went along, it was Dodson getting all the first-team time next to Milano. There are two plausible reasons for this until we get more information Thursday.</p><p>The first possibility is the Bills decided to get Dodson on even footing in terms of padded practices. The physical element is critical to the Bills’ decision on the starter, and because the team began with full pads only on Day 5, perhaps it wanted Dodson to get his first full day with the top unit in pads, while avoiding the optics of having Dodson working with the top unit on back-to-back days. If Spector is with the top unit on Day 7, that would be the likeliest explanation.</p><p>However, there is also a possibility the Bills have narrowed their search to just Dodson and Bernard, pushing Spector out of the competition. Considering how much they value fully padded practices for this role, it would be a slight surprise for Spector to have been eradicated from contention after only one non-padded opportunity. We’ll find out on Day 7, but it would make the most sense if Spector is next to Milano on Thursday.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Bills observations: High praise for James Cook, Terrel Bernard makes impact play</p></a><h2><a class=ath_autolink data-id=yynfZqHDAdhkOwK4 href=#>James Cook</a> heavily involved in pass game on Day 6</h2><p>Even though Josh Allen struggled down the stretch and had to be frustrated with all the pressure in his face, he still completed 12-of-19 pass attempts through team drills. And of those 12 completions, second-year running back James Cook came down with five of them. Cook was easily the Bills’ best offensive player with the first unit, making good reads on run opportunities and then showing off his speed and hands as an outlet for Allen.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>His best play was on a throw toward the sideline, where the running back zoomed out to the throw in the flat and caught it in stride, beating the lightning-fast Milano to the spot up the field. It was an easy-money type of rep, and if the super athletic Milano was slow to get to Cook for an early stop, they could really take advantage of slower linebackers in the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2 href=#>NFL</a> on game day. Cook has continued to look like the far-and-away top back at training camp and seems destined for at least over half of the offensive snaps this season if he continues this level of play.</p><h2><a class=ath_autolink data-id=JJbflEYt54YCFK0u href=#>Kaiir Elam</a> continues to get top-unit time</h2><p>The search for a running mate for cornerback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2AJ6oTJrxGnx7gDh href=#>Tre’Davious White</a> continued Tuesday. Dane Jackson, Benford and Kaiir Elam have all gotten their fair share of reps with the first-team unit, and on Day 6, Elam had his most extensive work there. There wasn’t a ton that stood out from Elam during team drills against the first unit except for the fact he was on the field, which is an action of trust from the coaching staff.</p><p>With three players vying for a spot and with each player having a varying number of reps with the top unit each day, it’s an elaborate rotation that isn’t as straightforward as middle linebacker. Jackson got first-team time through the first five days but didn’t get any on Day 6. Benford got first-team time each of the first three days, stayed on the second unit for the following two days, and then got more time with the top unit on Day 6. Elam didn’t get any legitimate first-team time until Day 4 but continued to get some on days 5 and 6. Benford has been the most impressive of the trio and has what defensive backs coach John Butler called “elite” processing skills. Regardless, we’re still some preseason games short of knowing who will win this job.</p><h2>Cam Lewis putting together a strong case to make the team again</h2><p>Although defensive back Lewis is seen by most as a fringe roster player for the 2023 Bills, he’s quietly putting together an excellent camp and has seen his opportunities increase across the board. We’ve seen him be a nickel and safety hybrid during a few days of camp, and Tuesday, as starter <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WpZKWArS36a5jGeu href=#>Jordan Poyer</a> sat out on a vet rest day, Lewis even occasionally worked in with the first unit at safety. He made the huge play to break up the pass on fourth down to Shakir near the end of the session, and he’s made several other good pass breakups at each position. That defensive versatility as a possible backup nickel and safety will go a long way for Lewis, and that’s before you even consider how valued he is by special teams coordinator Matthew Smiley. Lewis could also take the pressure off both the Bills and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=embojMAWMuz1cfqb href=#>Damar Hamlin</a> for Hamlin to be an immediate contributor on the 53-man roster. It would not be a surprise if the Bills keep five safeties this year, with Lewis fourth on the depth chart, giving the ability to make Hamlin a healthy scratch if the safety isn’t ready for game action by September.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Love to see it! 👏 <a href=#>#BillsCamp</a> <a href=#>@HamlinIsland</a> | <a href=#>@Ticketmaster</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8UnOSmxNCF</a></p><p>— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) <a href=#>August 1, 2023</a></p><h2>Damar Hamlin took his first big contact</h2><p>Although Monday will be remembered as the day <a href=# rel=noopener>Hamlin donned full pads for the first time</a> since January, it was Tuesday that brought on the first time he really popped the pads with an offensive player. It happened on a run play to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WZMAJS1OKUuaBf4l href=#>Damien Harris</a>, where Hamlin rushed toward the backfield from the defensive left side. An on-the-move <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1Z8oWXcTMIFRAxyr href=#>Dion Dawkins</a> caught Hamlin clean on a block that knocked him back a couple of steps. It was one where you could hear the pop of the pads from the sideline, and on the next play, Hamlin was right back in it, communicating and directing traffic from the defensive middle before the snap. There will be plenty of other firsts for Hamlin before it just becomes normal again, but that first big contact was a big step.</p><p><strong>Day 6 non-participants:</strong> S Jordan Poyer (vet rest), DT <a class=ath_autolink data-id=zMYnriWVJvQxaX1g href=#>Tim Settle</a> (groin), WR <a class=ath_autolink data-id=xMaJw46kLS2eJKGt href=#>Isaiah Coulter</a> (knee), WR <a class=ath_autolink data-id=W9CjNczem32tRh01 href=#>Bryan Thompson</a> (concussion), CB <a class=ath_autolink data-id=A4nqu4X5VzylRtm4 href=#>Kyron Brown</a> (groin), DE Von Miller (knee, PUP list), DT <a class=ath_autolink data-id=c8SuUOg5YQcWICH7 href=#>Jordan Phillips</a> (shoulder, PUP list), LB <a class=ath_autolink data-id=pIfFi6KJGEbmpAAT href=#>Tyler Matakevich</a> (calf, PUP list)</p><p>(Photo of Josh Allen: Gregory Fisher / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3BraWlha3xzfJFsZmlwX2V%2BcK7Un52apJ9ir6q4y6xkraqRnruqusZmmpqloGKCcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
