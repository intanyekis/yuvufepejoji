According to the lawsuit obtained by <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, "Defendants intentionally commercially marketed Spencer's child pornography and leveraged the shocking nature of his image to promote themselves and their music at his expense." Yet, according to US law, as the BBC <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a>, non-sexualized photos of infants don't fall under child pornography. However, Elden's lawyer, Robert Y. Lewis, argues that the image is child pornography. He states that the dollar bill makes Spenser look "like a sex worker" and that this photoshoot is nothing but sexual exploitation. In addition, Elden's suit alleges the group members and the photographer, Kirk Weddle, for using the picture without his parents' consent. The only benefit they got was $200, as his father <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> to NPR in 2008.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Weddle was Spenser's family friend who spontaneously offered to conduct the photo session. Three months after it, the family saw the picture on Sunset Blvd, on the Tower Records wall. Two months later, a 1-year-old Spenser got a teddy bear and a platinum album.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Bands Who Want To Be The Next Nirvana</a></span></p><p>So, the lawsuit seeks $150,000 from each defendant: the former group members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl, Kirk Weddle, Cobain's estate managers, Heather Parry and Guy Oseary, record companies and art directors who distributed the album in the last thirty years, and even Courtney Love, Kurt Cobain's executor estate and ex-wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As CBS News <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a>, Elden stated he got no compensation and "has suffered and will continue to suffer lifelong damages" because of the photoshoot. Indeed, in <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a> of the interviews, he mentioned that he feels uncomfortable playing baseball, knowing that the players had seen his genitalia when he was a child.</p><p><a href=#>Kurt Cobain Net Worth</a></p><p>Interestingly, Spencer recreated the cover album twice, in <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2008</a> and <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2016</a> but got paid $200 only for the second picture. One small remark - he wore shorts for both photoshoots. So, as Vanity Fair <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a>, Spencer has mixed feelings towards the legendary photo. After the 2016 photoshoot, he <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confessed</a> to Time magazine that he tried to reach those who assisted in the photoshoot but failed to get any contact from their side. "I just woke up already being a part of this huge project. It's pretty difficult—you feel like you're famous for nothing, but you didn't really do anything but their album," he said.</p><p>Apart from that, he mentioned that he gets upset realizing how much money the band got from this album. Well, it has sold more than 30 million copies since 1991, and it's considered the best in the history of rock music. Obviously, he got nothing from the sales. And, for now, none of the defendants has given any comments on that matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Rolling Stones: Rock's Billion Dollar Band Plays On</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS7psLEq6SippRir6Ku2GaqqZ2emLKzecSlm56mXajCqrrGZqWiqqaWu6J7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
