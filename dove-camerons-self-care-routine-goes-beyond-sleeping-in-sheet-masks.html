It's safe to say it goes beyond sheet masks.</p><p>“Healing is not always pretty,” she said. “Self care is not always face masks and fancy oils (though there’s nothing wrong with that). For me: self care right now is trauma work, writing, face time therapy, daily talks with myself about the acceptance of my life and my current state, attempting to stay physically healthy and not let my depression and anxiety win, and practicing patience.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner’s Bare Face Breaks the Internet Again, As Many Celebrities Embrace Natural Beauty</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqK6VYrCiucSrpqerXaiyrbKMnJirnV2nvLbAyKecZp%2BfmsBursSypqecXai5prHPoqWgZZmjerS0xJ6rZqWRqLi0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
