While the specific cause of his death has not been disclosed, the news was met with a wave of sadness from colleagues, readers, and the broader sports community.</p><p>Deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Jim Caple, who on top of being an incredible baseball scribe was truly a kind and funny guy. Everyone seems to have a story about him, and here is mine. While my schedule was cramped, I had figured out a way to fly down to San Francisco and back on the same day to cover Game 1 of the 2010 World Series between the Rangers and Giants. Starters were Lincecum and Lee so I figured it would be some pitchers duel and booked my return flight for 10pm. I mean, how long could the game be? Turns out, longer than expected. First ball hit was between Lincecum and Pablo Sandoval at 3rd. They both converge on the ball and stare at it. I was sitting between Jim and Jon Heyman in the press box. We all looked at each other as if to say, “It’s going to be that kind of game.”For all MLB jewel events, the media is gifted with a program and a pin commemorating the event. At 9pm, I turn to Jim and say, “I can’t believe this, but I have to leave the game to catch my flight.” Jim had never met me before. We knew of each other in passing due to Northwest SABR meetings, but that was was it. The pin and program had not yet been passed out but as I’m packing my stuff up he turns to me and says, “Give me your address so I can mail them to you.” It was such a kind and thoughtful thing. A couple weeks later it arrived in the mail. I messaged to ask how much I owed for postage. “Nah. It’s all good.”We never know how the smallest of things can mean so much. Farewell, Jim. Such a sad, sad day.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Remembering_Jim_Caple></span><strong>Remembering Jim Caple</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jim Caple leaves behind a rich legacy in sports journalism.
