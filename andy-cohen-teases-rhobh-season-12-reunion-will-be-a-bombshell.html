I feel so much sympathy for the widows and orphans left behind,” Jenkins <a href=#>wrote via Instagram</a> at the time. “I know firsthand the pain and suffering that accompanies the loss of a family member, having lost my brother in the closing days of the Bosnian War. I want to do what I can to support those people who suffered so much.”</p><p class=x_p1>Jenkins noted that she will be making the donation through her new charity, The Sunela Foundation — a non-profit partnered with GVNG to help raise funds for various causes.</p><p class=x_p1>Prior to the Bosnia native’s RHOBH debut, Jayne, 51, made headlines after she filed for divorce from <a href=#><strong>Tom Girardi</strong> </a>after 21 years of marriage.
